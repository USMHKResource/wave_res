\begin{itemize}
\item This approach captures both local and remote resource
\item ‘Best estimate’ of total U.S. wave resource is XXX TWh/yr
\item This is theoretical, not ‘technical’ resource.
\item Combine theoretical resource estimates with device data to estimate ‘technical potential’ (AEP) for a project. i.e., this looks at methods to improve IEC standards based on this work.
\item The remote results are closer to the EPRI 2004 resource assessment results, which utilized wave directionality and the EEZ boundary.
\end{itemize}
