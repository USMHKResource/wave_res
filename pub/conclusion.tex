\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

Including the natural or potential local resource in estimates of total theoretical wave energy assessments -- as proposed herein -- is a fundamental change in methodology. There are several practical questions about how this energy can be harnessed on both large and small scales. 
Most importantly, we note that the ``potential local'' resource only becomes available when large-scale wave energy extraction becomes a reality. Even the ``natural local'' resource doesn't become a significant component of a wave energy projects resource until the size of the project is greater than several thousand square kilometers. \note{Need to check on these numbers.}

There is also work to be done in understanding how much of the local resource overlaps with the offshore wind resource (i.e., does extracting wave energy -- so that the wave surface is flatter -- reduce or increase the offshore wind resource?).

There is also the question of what kinds of devices will efficiently harness this relatively high-frequency energy. Will new device designs be required to harness that energy? If so, will they be economically competitive? Or, will WEC devices of the future be sufficiently broad-banded to extract the local resource and remote resource equally efficiently? 

Though these issues exist, we still believe that including the local resource in the total is important for several reasons. First and foremost, it is a real part of the total energy that is contained in the resource, and available for conversion to electricity. Therefore, it falls squarely in the IEC definition of ``theoretical resource''. Second, including it resolves outstanding questions associated with earlier resource assessments (i.e., ``how much energy is available inshore of a chosen boundary?''). And third, including it broadens our understanding of what wave energy is. That is, there is a significant amount of energy at relatively high frequency that could be useful for PBE applications that require relatively small amounts of power. Furthermore, the methodology proposed here -- which has been applied at a regional scale -- can also be applied at the project scale (e.g., down to a single device represented by a small box).
This accuracy at all scales makes it ideally suited for broader adoption by the international community, which will in turn make the assessment of market opportunities more comparable and transparent.

% I'm pretty sure we want to stay away from this?!:
% \subsection{Long term potential of wave energy?}
% ... but I do think we want to talk 'around' it...

\begin{itemize}
\item What does this new method and the results {\it mean} for wave energy?
\item This provides a consistent methodology for accounting for wave energy at national/regional scales. So that policy makers can have a clear understanding of wave energy potential. As other nations/regions adopt the methodology, we will have an apples-to-apples comparison of opportunity, which can inform decision making and investment.
\item How does this methodology relate to IEC standards (project RA)?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This methodology is consistent with other methods
  \item ...but care must be taken in developing project-scale methods that are consistent with this...
  \item OWP {\it is still useful} for project-scale RA
  \end{itemize}
\item Harnessing a significant portion of the local resource will mean creating wave farms very far from shore (recovery length-scale of wave energy is O(300 km) / or: storm scales \note{Citation?}).
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Do we talk about energy storage?
  \item The changing political/economic landscape and the future energy economy?
  \item Decentralized generation?
  \item A new RE fuels economy?
  \end{itemize}
\item Resource is co-located with coastal population centers, especially on U.S. West Coast.
\item Overlap between 'local' resource and OSW resource, but opportunity for wave-OSW hybrid still exists!
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Predictability of wave energy}

\begin{itemize}
\item Predictability on 3day to 1-week time scales (need citations for this! \note{GGM: help with citations here?})?
\item ENSO correlation. \citep{yangCharacteristicsVariabilityNearshore2020,andersonClimateIndexOptimized2018}, \note{cite: Anderson et.al. 2018, OR coastal erosion as an example of the kinds of process studies that can inform engineering?}
\item This is just the beginning... what can machine learning + big earth datasets do for wave energy predictability?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion re PBE}
% Need to review the PBE reports.

\begin{itemize}
\item Growing blue-economy!
\item Coastal resiliency?
\item What about mitigating coastal erosion? ... {\it Issue here: WEC devices shut-down during the big events that cause erosion?! ... but what about future tech?!}
\item What about marine shipping?
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item This approach captures both local and remote resource. It was created to resolve lingering questions about wave energy theoretical potential.
\item This is theoretical. Next work: ‘technical’.
\item ‘Best estimate’ of total U.S. wave resource is XXX TWh/yr
\item Combine theoretical resource estimates with device data to estimate ‘technical potential’ (AEP) for a project. i.e., this looks at methods to improve IEC standards based on this work.
\item The remote results are closer to the EPRI 2004 resource assessment results, which utilized wave directionality and the EEZ boundary.
\end{itemize}
