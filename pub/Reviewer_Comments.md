1. "the resource (wave energy) is concentrated along coastlines": please confirm reasonableness of this statement.

Revised sentence to be "resource is delivered to the coastlines"


2. Add details of applying different metrics to assess wave-energy estimation accuracies, e.g., from originally simulated and observed wave energies to the value of metrics.


3. The authors claimed that several drawbacks of previous studies were addressed in this study. Please quantitatively demonstrate advances of wave-energy estimation resulting from innovations of this study in addressing them.

4. Please comprehensively compare estimates of regional wave-energy resources over USA with previous ones.


Reviewer #2

The authors present a novel methodology for characterizing wave energy resource that is complementary to the existing international standards. Currently, there are no guidelines to ensure all regional studies are undertaken using the same method. These existing inconsistencies when addressing wave resource estimations are explained in depth and a solution is proposed where terms are clearly defined and justified, e.g. the use of the EEZ as a boundary and the need to include the local resource. This methodology would be extremely valuable to the sector if it is adopted as a standard as it would allow to compare studies and resources at different regions. Additionally, the methodology is used in the paper to provide updated resource values for the US. Overall a well written and organized paper with clear and concise English. Although some sections seem quite long (e.g. Section 2 Background), I appreciate the need to explain and define terms in depth so that this can be clear and reproducible. The methodology is well explained in the appendices.
I recommend this paper for publication as I believe it covers a gap in the wave resource assessment research and it is of good quality. I suggest some minor revisions and clarifications in the following lines.
I apologize for the number of comments, they are all minor suggestions or typos though.

i. Line 19: please consider changing European Union to Europe, as this term includes countries with strong Blue Economy agendas, such as the UK and Norway.

ii. Line 103: Is O(1,000 km2) a big O notation? I don't quite understand the use of it here.

iii. Line 158-159: suggest changing "such those" to "such as those"

iv. Line 173: I think there is a typo: "indluce" - "include"
v. Line 184: "wave resource classes" here is related to energy classes and does not refer to the same classes as in line 125 (IEC classes), maybe some clarification could be included to avoid confusion.
vi. Line 191-195: Very long sentence, consider restructuring.
vii. Line 196: For consistency, suggest using IEC 62600-101 as in the previous text to avoid confusion.
viii. Equation 1: consider rearranging terms so that they appear in the same order as the text, e.g. move Sbrk to the end.
ix. Line 239: Typo, missing space between "etal"
x. Line 247: Is it possible the resolution of the regional models is wrong? I believe it should be 10' - 4'. The symbol for minutes is a single ', a double " is for seconds. From Chawla et al. 2011 : Grids of three different resolutions were generated: low resolution (1/2° or 30 arc-minutes), mid resolution (1/6° or 10 arc-minutes) and high resolution (1/15° or 4 arc-minutes). Additionally, I suggest the same units are used to describe the models' resolution (e.g. 30', 10', 4' or 1/2°, 1/6°, 1/15°) so that it is easier to compare them.
xi. Line 248-249: Please could you clarify what depth is considered shallow waters?
xii. Line 249: For consistency I suggest changing 'IEC TS 62600-101' to 'IEC 62600-101'.
xiii. Line 274: Could "most of" be defined as a percentage, for example?
xiv. Line 291-295: Suggest defining the terms in order of appearance in the equation and briefly including δ in this paragraph.
xv. Line 350: Suggest clarifying if 5% and <2% is of the total resource (RT) for that area or the total inner shelf resource (across areas).
xvi. Line 364-365: "b) it is far enough offshore that water depth are typically too large for mooring" With the current technology, I agree depth is a limiting factor. However, can we make this simplification elsewhere? Different areas of the world present different bathymetry and some have very shallow continental shelves, which could mean they are able to exploit the resource further offshore than 10 nmi. By limiting the inner-shelf resource to 10 nmi you may be limiting the practical/technical resource estimation in other parts of the world. This said, I understand that setting the inner-shelf boundary to a bathymetric contour would make the boundary line much more complex and therefore more double-crossings may occur more frequently.
xvii. Figure 1: It is hard to see if there is more than 1 caribbean station. If there are more, I would suggest bringing these forwards as its shape won't cover the others. I suggest expanding the caption to make it easier to understand the figure and adjusting the position of the RMSD 0.25 so that it is easier to see. I think having the x-axis label below the axis would help with quick comprehension of the figure.
xviii. Line 348-408: the term "near-shore resource" is added here. Is it synonym of "inner-shelf resource"? I suggest using the same terms for consistency and clarity.
xix. Line 428: suggest the use of term "energy matrix" or "energy mix" rather than "energy profile".
xx. Line 463: Typo: wave technologies continue (vs. continues)
xxi. Table 1: I suggest adding a column with the local resource (RL), as it is a good summary of the figures given throughout section 4 and it also reflects how in some areas it is important to include this part of the resource in the total, backing up the need for including this in standard methodology.
xxii. Figure 3: Revise units (e.g kw/m should be kW/m and tWh/year should be TWh/year)
xxiii. Figure 4: Include y-axis label
xxiv. Figure 5: Include x-axis label. Define what the + is on each curve in the caption.
xxv. Line 555: Consider mentioning ENSO fluctuations and Figure 6 earlier in the text. For example, it would be a good fit when inter-annual variability is addressed at the beginning of section 4 (lines 413-421)
xxvi. Figure A.3: Define † in the caption.
xxvii. Table A.2: Remote resource for Alaska does not coincide with value presented in Table 1 of the main text
xxviii. Line 779: Typo "stead state" should be "steady state"
