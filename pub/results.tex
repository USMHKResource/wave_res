\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Following the methodology described in the previous section, we estimate the total U.S. Resource to be 3300 TWh/yr, and perhaps as high as 4090 TWh/yr when including the potential resource (Table~\ref{table:totals}).

Nearly two-thirds of the nation's wave energy resource is in Alaska where a large resource area and energetic waves in the North Pacific combine to create a large total (2000 – 2550 TWh/yr). The U.S. West Coast has a large remote resource (420 TWh/yr) where energetic waves from the Pacific arrive from offshore.  The West Coast natural local resource is modest in comparison (90 TWh/yr), but there is potentially another 210 TWh/yr available in the potential resource.

The U.S. East Coast resource, on the other hand, is composed primarily of the local resource (180 – 230 TWh/yr) and has a relatively modest remote piece (110 TWh/yr). This is because mid-latitude westerly winds tend to generate wave energy that propagates eastward, and thus relatively less wave energy from the open ocean propagates onshore toward the U.S. eastern coastline (compared to the U.S. west coast). This also indicates that much of the east coast wave resource is located farther from shore, where there strong offshore winds across the sizable (200 nautical mile) fetch of the EEZ create significant wave energy.

Hawaii has a large resource due largely to waves that arrive from the North Pacific along the northern boundary of the EEZ surrounding the islands. The natural local resource is relatively small, due primarily to the fact that the sea-state in this region is -- in the long-average perspective presented here, and compared to regions such as the East Coast where wave growth dominates, or compared to the `potential' case -- roughly `steady-state' because the wind input and dissipation are relatively balanced.

The Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean region on the other hand, has a modest wave resource composed predominantly of local wind input. The remote resource in this region is also very small because the majority of the U.S. EEZ boundary throughout this region borders other EEZs (\ref{appendix:one-way-method}).

\subsection{The ``Inner Shelf'' Resource}

In order to identify a more realistic near-term estimate of the wave resource (e.g., for the next decade or so) we also compute $R_T$ using a 10 nautical-mile boundary, and refer to this as the ``inner shelf'' resource (last column in Table \ref{table:totals}). In this case, the local resource (both $R_{L_\circ}$ and $R_{L_*}$) is small for all regions (5\% in Alaska, <2\% for all other regions), so we have only presented $R_T$.

The inner-shelf resource totals are somewhat surprising because even though they are composed primarily of the remote resource several regions (Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) actually have a larger inner-shelf resource than remote resource at the EEZ. This is mostly due to the fact that the inner-shelf integration contour is actually {\em longer} than the EEZ contour in these regions. This, in turn, is partly due to the geometry of the region (e.g., the Gulf of Mexico), and also to the fact that the EEZ contour does not include borders with other nation's EEZs while the `inner shelf' resource is not clipped in this way (e.g., Puerto Rico). The energy input by the wind between 200 and 10 nautical-miles from shore may also play a role. 

It is also interesting that the west coast inner-shelf resource (95.5\% remote) is very nearly the same as the resource at the edge of the EEZ. This suggests that the vast majority of the wave energy generated by local winds between the EEZ and the inner-shelf contour actually propagates offshore.

The Hawaiian resource decreases significantly from the EEZ to inner-shelf because the latter -- i.e., the 10 nautical-mile boundary, which is actually four separate contours around island groups -- is much shorter than the full EEZ boundary. The east coast inner-shelf resource is somewhat smaller than the EEZ remote resource because some of that energy has been removed by whitecapping caused by the westerly winds that create the large local resource in this region (i.e., the eastward winds reduce the energy in westward-propagating waves).

\subsection{Comparing to EPRI 2011}
\noteB{I'm not really happy with this section. Does it belong in the discussion section? Should I drop most of it and just merge the first paragraph into the opening paragraph of section \ref{sec:results}? Have I already beat the ``EPRI 2011 was wrong'' drum too much?}

Our estimate of the total wave energy resource is 25-50\% larger than the EPRI 2011 assessment. This result, however, should not be interpreted too strongly because the majority of this increase is due to including the ``local resource'' over the vast U.S. EEZ, and it is unclear whether this is a technically viable resource. That is, while the energy is theoretically available and contained within U.S. maritime boundaries it is likely to be especially technically challenging to harness.
%In other words, this work has not ``discovered new wave energy'', so much as modified the methodology to account for the wave energy potential over the entirety of the U.S.'s EEZ.

It is also useful to compare the remote results derived here to what was done in EPRI 2011 for two reasons: 1) only the remote resource was computed in that work, and 2) it has been the standard for the U.S. DOE Wave Resource assessment for several years. 
Most regions, except Hawaii, have a lower remote resource compared to EPRI 2011. The reasons for these changes are due to the methodological changes described in section \ref{sec:method:changes}, and all of the changes described there play some role in the final result. However, each region has a {primary \em} reason for the change, and these are discussed in the following paragraph.

The Hawaii resource is the exception to the rule because the EEZ boundary surrounding the State's islands (used here) is much longer than than the 200-m isobath used in the EPRI 2011 results.
Alaska and the West Coast are reduced by approximately 30\%, primarily due to accounting for wave directionality.
The Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean island territories are reduced by large fractions primarily because the integration contour used here is much shorter than was utilized in EPRI 2011. This small integration contour is due to the fact that the majority of the EEZ boundary in these regions is a {\it border} with a neighboring nation's EEZ, and therefore is not considered as described in section \ref{sec:method:calc:remote}.
The East Coast is reduced primarily because this method does not include wave energy that fluxes offshore, which makes up a sizable portion of this region's local resource (i.e., it is counted there, not as part of the remote resource).

Adding the local resource to the total flips the story. The magnitude of the local resource for most regions is comparable to the remote resource so that when it is included in the total, it more than makes up for the reduction in the remote resource and makes the total U.S. resource 25-50\% larger than the EPRI 2011 estimate.


\subsection{Wave energy distribution within regions}\label{sec:results:wc-dist}

Bulk power quantities can be used to compare large regions as was done in the previous sections. However the wave resource is not spatially nor seasonally homogeneous. In this section we explore the variability of wave resource in two regions, the West Coast and East Coast. Wave power in the West Coast has a strong seasonal signal with energetic winters and calmer summers (Figure~\ref{fig:maps-wc}). In the Winter, Spring, and Autumn the wave power is stronger offshore Washington and Oregon and weakens southward. These characteristics have been described in previous works \citep[e.g.][]{garcia-medinaWaveResourceAssessment2014,lenee-bluhm_characterizing_2011,yangCharacteristicsVariabilityNearshore2020}. However, during the Summer there is stronger resource offshore California. This is associated with persistent northerly winds that average over 10 m/s during the season (Figure~\ref{fig:maps-wc} second row). The effect of these winds can be seen in areas of elevated local resource (both natural and potential) and wind speeds. There is also the counter-intuitive case offshore of Oregon and Washington during the winter, where the winds are strong but the natural resource is small. This is because the seas are more developed and local wave growth is not as important. In this case, the potential resource is large because it does not include the remote waves and therefore the seas grow in response to the wind field.

% There are two distinct wind patterns in the West Coast. Stronger winds are present in the winter offshore Oregon and Washington and weaken in the summer. Offshore southern Oregon and California the pattern is opposite. Natural resource is largest in the summer than in the winter with the majority of it focused offshore California. The potential resource shows similar behavior to the natural resource but it is stronger in the winter offshore Oregon and Washington. This is because the undisturbed wave field is closer to being in equilibrium, fully developed sea, during this season.

In the East Coast the seasonal cycle of the wind is similar to that of the northern West Coast, with stronger winds in the winter and weaker in the summer (Figure~\ref{fig:maps-at}). The offshore directed winds result in stronger resource near the edge of the EEZ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:maps-at}. Note that the omnidirectional wave power shows the combined effect of local and remote resource. In general the higher density of natural resource is located offshore of northern New England. In the East Coast, however, the natural resource across the entire area is minimal during the Summer.

\subsection{Annual cycle of wave energy resource}

The annual cycle of the wave energy resource has a remarkably consistent pattern across all U.S. regions (Figure \ref{fig:annual-cycle}). Wave energy is a late-fall and winter dominated resource. The resource peaks in December or January across all regions, and is at a minimum in summer months. The inter-annual variability of the monthly-averaged West Coast resource is small during summer months when the resource is small (Figure \ref{fig:wc-variability}). During energetic winter months, the monthly-averaged resource can vary by more than 50\%, but in general the inter-annual variability is less than 30\% of the month's mean. This suggests that during energetic winter months wave energy projects should be expected to deliver at least their annual mean, with the potential of providing much more than that. However, more detailed analysis is required to demonstrate these characteristics at specific sites and for specific technologies. Other regions have similar variability characteristics (not shown for simplicity).

\subsection{Wave-period dependence of wave resource}

The US wave energy resource has distinct regional wave-period (frequency) characteristics (Figure \ref{fig:remote-freq}, thick lines). The Atlantic regions (Gulf and East Coast) are dominated by relatively short-period waves compared to the Pacific. The Gulf (including Puerto Rico and U.S.V.I.) resource is particularly high-frequency with a peak at ~6.5 seconds, and 95\% of the energy having a period of less than 12 seconds. The East Coast resource is somewhat lower frequency than the Gulf with a peak at ~10 seconds, and 95\% of the energy less than 15 seconds.

The West Coast resource has a much wider and longer-period distribution, with 90\% of the resource contained between 6.5 and 19 seconds, with a peak at 14 seconds. This is largely because the west coast resource is dominated by long-period swell that has arrived at the U.S. coastline from storms in the distant Pacific (both North and South Pacific). The Hawaiian resource is bi-modal with a peak at 14 seconds and a peak at 9 seconds. This ``double-peak'' is primarily a seasonal effect where waves with period 11-12 seconds are more prevalent in January and February, while waves with period 8-10 seconds arrive in March and April \citep[][]{stopa2013wave}. The Alaskan resource has a spectral peak at 12 seconds, with 90\% of the resource between 6 and 17 seconds.

Finally, we note that including the potential resource (thin lines in Figure \ref{fig:remote-freq}) in the spectral distribution shifts the distribution to higher frequency, and adds a short-period (high-frequency) peak at 2 to 4 seconds compared to the remote only resource (thick lines). This is the influence of the wind input terms, which tend to add energy at high-frequency. The effect is essentially the same when adding the natural local resource (not shown). The low-period (high-frequency) energy contained in the local resource has not typically been of interest to the WEC community, but as interest in niche PBE markets grow - especially those involving small WECs for low power applications - there may be more interest in this portion of the wave energy spectrum.
