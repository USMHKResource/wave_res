It is also interesting The west coast's inner-shelf theoretical resource (410~TWh/yr, table \ref{table:totals}) is equal to ~40\% of electricity consumption of California, Oregon, and Washington (2018 total: 943 TWh/yr), which suggests that there is sufficient resource to play a sizable role in the region's energy profile in the foreseeable future \citep{energyinformationadministrationStateEnergyConsumption2020}.  These factors suggest that the west coast is the premier U.S. market for utility-scale wave energy. 



\subsection{Taken from discussion - is any of this needed?}

Including the natural or potential local resource in estimates of total theoretical wave energy assessments -- as we propose here -- is a fundamental change in methodology. There are several practical questions about how this energy can be harnessed on both large and small scales. 
The potential local resource only becomes available when large-scale wave energy extraction becomes economically feasible at great distance from shore. 

More work is needed to understand how much of the local resource overlaps with the offshore wind resource, and to identify what kinds of wave devices will efficiently harness the relatively high-frequency energy contained in the local resource. Though these questions and limitations exist, we still argue that including the local resource in the total theoretical resource is important for several reasons.
%\note{Z says: "we still argue" may be too weak? But I think it's the right tone?}

First, it is a real part of the total energy that is available -- or potentially available -- for conversion to electricity. Second, including it resolves outstanding questions associated with earlier resource assessments, thereby providing clarity to how regional wave resource assessments should be completed.  Third, including it broadens our understanding of what wave energy is; including it in our assessments gives a more complete picture of the opportunity. Fourth, and finally, the methodology proposed here -- which we have been applied at a regional scale -- can also be applied at the project scale to give an estimate of the theoretical resource at a site. This accuracy at all scales makes it ideally suited for broader adoption by the international community, which will in turn make the assessment of wave energy opportunities more comparable and transparent.
