Qs for GGM
----

1. How hard would it be to extend the data to 2019 (2018?)? -> It will take about one month of runtime. The problem are the computational resources in PNNL where we have to pay from a project. This could be a Zhaoqing question.

  \caption{The scale-vs-type conceptual space of resource-assessment. \note{Need to think more about how this fits with Table 1 in IEC wave RA (-101). That table is focused primarily on accuracy/uncertainty of the approach, but it also overlaps with scale (last column). We could either: a) include that table adjacent to this one, or somehow summarize it as a column or two here. But, mostly I think there is something here about how the ``accuracy-focused'' approach there is sorta outdated b/c we can now run fairly high-accuracy/resolution models at large-scale.} }
