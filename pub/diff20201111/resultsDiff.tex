\section{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Results: }\DIFdelend Wave Energy \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Resource }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Resources }\DIFaddend of the United States}
\label{sec:results}

We estimate the total wave energy resource of the U.S. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{— i.e., across the entirety of the EEZ — }\DIFdelend to be 3300 TWh/yr, and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{inner-shelf }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{near-shore }\DIFaddend resource to be 1900 TWh/yr (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Table \ref{table:totals}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure \ref{fig:map-total}}\DIFaddend ). 
These values are, respectively, 25\% higher than and 39\% lower than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{those estimated in }\DIFdelend the EPRI 2011 wave resource assessment \citep[][]{EPRIwaveresource2011}. 
Because the integration contour used in EPRI 2011 is between the EEZ and near-shore boundaries we use here, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{these }\DIFaddend results are qualitatively consistent with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{EPRI 2011. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that work. 
}\DIFaddend At the same time, these results are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{more accurate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{higher accuracy }\DIFaddend due to improvements in the methodology and underlying models\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, including the use a longer record to quantify the resource in this study}\DIFdelend . Furthermore, the difference between the full-EEZ and near-shore results emphasize the importance of being clear and consistent when choosing the boundary where the wave resource is estimated.

\subsection{The U.S. West Coast}

The west coast is a promising region for wave energy because it possesses a large total resource (510 TWh/yr\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{across EEZ}\DIFdelend ) and has the coastal population density to make use of it. The inner-shelf resource (410~TWh/yr) is equal to $\sim40$\% of the electricity consumption of California, Oregon, and Washington (2018 total: 943 TWh/yr), which suggests \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend there is sufficient resource to play a sizable role in the region's energy profile in the foreseeable future \citep{energyinformationadministrationStateEnergyConsumption2020}. The resource along the northern half of the west coast — Oregon, Washington, and Northern California — is particularly energetic: the annual-average wave energy flux exceeds 40 kW/m in several places.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure~\ref{fig:map-total} shows the spatial distribution of the resource.

This resource is composed primarily of long-period waves — 90\% of the resource is contained between 6.5 and 19 seconds (Figure \ref{fig:remote-freq}) — which carry more energy per-unit of wave amplitude. These waves arrive at the shoreline from throughout the Pacific basin \citep{perezESTELAMethodEvaluating2014}. The PacWave test site, offshore of central Oregon, has been created to be the first U.S. "grid-connected full-scale test facility", is critical to testing wave technologies and demonstrating that they can perform efficiently and reliably in this world-class fully-energetic environment where winter storms regularly deliver waves \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with }\DIFdelend more than 8 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{m }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{meters }\DIFaddend in amplitude \citep[e.g.][]{allan_climate_2006}.

\DIFdelend \subsection{The U.S. East Coast}

The east coast also possesses a sizable wave energy resource (290 TWh/yr), but it is composed primarily of the local resource (180 TWh/yr). This is because mid-latitude westerly winds tend to generate wave energy that propagates eastward and builds to a sizable resource across the broad fetch of the U.S. EEZ. Relatively less wave energy — compared to the West Coast at least — from the open Atlantic propagates onshore toward the U.S. eastern coastline\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(compared to the U.S. west coast)}\DIFdelend . The remote resource, therefore, is relatively modest (110 TWh/yr at the EEZ, and 90 TWh/yr on the inner-shelf). Because this resource is dominated by waves that are generated locally, the waves tend to be much shorter-period (90\% of the energy is between 6 and 15 seconds, Figure \ref{fig:remote-freq}).

The offshore directed winds cause the most energetic wave resource to be located near the edge of the EEZ offshore of New England (Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{fig:map-total}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:maps}}\DIFaddend ). Note here that the omni-directional wave power shows the combined effect of local and remote resource. The east coast inner-shelf resource is somewhat smaller than the EEZ remote resource because a fraction of energy in these westward-propagating remote waves are dissipated by white-capping from the westerly winds.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For a detailed description of the directionality and variability of the wave power, the reader is referred to \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{ahnNearshoreWaveEnergy2021}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFdelend 

While the East Coast wave resource is modest in comparison to the West Coast, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it is too early to neglect }\DIFaddend the potential for wave energy \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{cannot be neglected}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{here}\DIFaddend . As wave technologies continues to mature and if the cost of the technology is low enough, sites and regions previously considered uneconomical may prove to be attractive, especially in markets where energy prices are already high and alternate renewable sources are limited or constrained. 

\subsection{Hawaii}

Hawaii also possesses a large resource (380 TWh/yr) composed primarily of waves propagating southward from the North Pacific. The local resource is relatively small (10 TWh/yr), due primarily to the fact that the sea-state in this region is -- in the long-average perspective of regional resource assessment -- approximately `steady-state' because the wind input and dissipation are nearly in balance. The inner-shelf Hawaiian resource (120 TWh/yr) is smaller than the EEZ remote resource because the the 10 nautical-mile boundary is a much ``smaller net'' in comparison to the full EEZ.

Hawaii is a particularly interesting case because the resource is large compared to the State's electricity consumption (26 TWh/yr), and because energy-prices are high. Wave energy may be particularly valued in Hawaii where space is limited for land-based renewable alternatives; and the tourist economy may especially value WECs with limited surface expression. Together, these factors make Hawaii a likely early-market for wave energy technology. The Navy's Wave Energy Test Site on the north shore of Oahu, is supporting the development and demonstration of technologies for meeting the potential demand \citep{crossEarlyResearchEfforts2015}.

The Hawaiian resource is bi-modal with a peak at 14 seconds and a peak at 9 seconds. This ``double-peak'' is primarily a seasonal effect where waves with period 11-12 seconds are more prevalent in January and February, while waves with period 8-10 seconds arrive in March and April \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[][]{stopa2013wave}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . 

\subsection{Alaska}

Nearly two-thirds of the nation's wave energy resource is in Alaska (2000 TWh/yr). However, the majority of this resource is `stranded' very far from markets large enough to utilize more than a few MW of power. Still, if the cost of large-scale energy storage technologies become sufficiently economical (e.g., renewable fuels, batteries, etc.), or if energy-intensive industrial activity were sited in this region, this wave resource could become valuable. In the shorter-term, the villages along Alaska's coastline -- where energy prices are very high -- represent an opportunity to demonstrate commercial viability before scaling the technology up \cite{alaskaenergyauthority2019PowerCost2020}. Or this energy could be used in-place for Blue Economy applications such as charging batteries on vessels or for scientific instruments during long transits or exploration. 

\subsection{Gulf of Mexico, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands}

The Gulf of Mexico's wave resource is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{small compared to the rest of the regions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{rather small}\DIFaddend , composed almost exclusively of locally-generated, short-period waves.  The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{wide shelf in this region also has the effect of damping out any waves that are generated. The }\DIFaddend presence of hurricanes in this region confounds the challenge of developing wave energy projects because devices would need to be designed to survive the extreme conditions that come with hurricanes. The same basic conclusions can also be drawn for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Throughout the Gulf and these islands there may be niche applications, or specific sites, where wave energy can be utilized. But it seems unlikely that utility-scale wave power will contribute significantly to the power needs.
