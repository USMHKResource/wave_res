\section{Introduction}

% Need to define `theoretical resource assessment'

% Also probably want to include the `multi-arrow' diagram here?

% Need to define "WEC" somewhere.

The methodology developed here has been guided by the successes and limitations of previous works. In particular, several previous works have accurately quantified the remote resource, while others have utilized approaches that have been criticized for 'double counting'. Those works have shot back that, "sure, but you're not accounting for local winds".
\note{How to say this more tactfully?}
