\begin{abstract}
Waves deliver massive quantities of energy to populated coastlines around the world, and wave energy technology research and development has accelerated over the last two decades. Throughout this time national and regional resource assessments have utilized disparate methodologies, which can cause confusion and skepticism. In this work we describe a theoretical wave resource assessment methodology that addresses many of the major areas of inconsistency and debate. Applying this revised methodology to U.S. waters, we find the U.S. wave energy resource to be 3300 – 4100 TWh/yr, with region totals of: 2000 – 2500 TWh/yr in Alaska, 510 – 630 TWh/yr along the U.S. west coast, 380 – 470 TWh/yr along the east coast, 70 TWh/yr in the Gulf of Mexico, and 18-33 TWh/yr in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
