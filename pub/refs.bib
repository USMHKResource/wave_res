They typically establish standard classes of power, a measure of the opportunity for energy resource capture. In this study, we develop wave energy resource classification systems for the US based on wave power (J, kW/m) and its distribution with peak period (Tp,s). These metrics are calculated for 70,386 sites from partitioned bulk wave parameters generated from a validated 30-year WaveWatch III model hindcast. As the operating resonant period bandwidth of a wave energy converter (WEC) technology is an important design characteristic, the dominant period band containing the largest energy content is identified among three peak period band classes. These classification systems, comprised of four power classes and three peak period band classes, are based on the total wave power or the partitioned wave power in the dominant peak period band. They discriminate distinct trends in wave energy resource among five regions within the US, and provide useful information for energy planners, project developers, and technology designers. They also establish a framework for investigating the feasibility of a compatible wave climate (design load) conditions and WEC technology classification system to reduce design and manufacturing costs.},

Annual energy was calculated in the study region with the hindcast data set covering 15 years (1995\textendash 2009). The areas with the highest wave energy resource were determined and the south west coasts of the Black Sea are suggested as the best site for the installation of a wave farm.

  abstract = {Abstract. The performance of two methods for quantifying whitecapping dissipation incorporated in the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) wave model is evaluated for waves generated along and off the US east coast under energetic winter storms with a predominantly westerly wind. Parameterizing the whitecapping effect can be done using the Komen-type schemes, which are based on mean spectral parameters, or the saturation-based (SB) approach of van der Westhuysen~(2007), which is based on local wave parameters and the saturation level concept of the wave spectrum (we use ``Komen'' and ``Westhuysen'' to denote these two approaches). Observations of wave parameters and frequency spectra at four National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys are used to evaluate simulation results. Model\textendash data comparisons show that when using the default parameters in SWAN, both Komen and Westhuysen methods underestimate wave height. Simulations of mean wave period using the Komen method agree with observations, but those using the Westhuysen method are substantially lower. Examination of source terms shows that the Westhuysen method underestimates the total energy transferred into the wave action equations, especially in the lower frequency bands that contain higher spectral energy. Several causes for this underestimation are identified. The primary reason is the difference between the wave growth conditions along the east coast during winter storms and the conditions used for the original whitecapping formula calibration. In addition, some deficiencies in simulation results are caused along the coast by the ``slanting fetch'' effect that adds low-frequency components to the 2-D wave spectra. These components cannot be simulated partly or entirely by available source terms (wind input, whitecapping, and quadruplet) in models and their interaction. Further, the effect of boundary layer instability that is not considered in the Komen and Westhuysen whitecapping wind input formulas may cause additional underestimation.},

In Uruguay, investment in renewable energy has experienced strong growth in recent years. Because the country is located in a microtidal zone, wave energy is the most promising marine energy resource. An assessment of its potential was conducted from a 31-year wave hindcast performed with the Wavewatch III\textregistered{} third-generation wave model forced by CFSR (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) winds. The model was calibrated and validated with altimeter data and in situ measurements. The spatial distribution of the resource and its variability at different timescales were analyzed, as well as the correlation between the variability of the directional wave spectrum and several climate indexes. The extreme conditions that a wave energy converter should withstand were analyzed, and a new figure was defined to quantify the impact of extreme conditions on WEC (Wave energy converter) design and optimization. The obtained results show that although wave energy potential is moderate, it is fairly steady throughout the year, and the extreme waves are relatively benign. Therefore, wave energy is an attractive resource for integration into the country energy mix, contributing to its diversification and sustainability.},

  abstract = {Pyroclastic flows and snow avalanches sometimes exhibit a rapid deceleration of their dense flow fronts and detachment of their dilute clouds. This behavior is also inferred for submarine flows and could explain stepped thickness patterns in their deposits. A similar ``abrupt transition'' process occurs in particle-laden, lock release laboratory currents with relatively high concentrations. New experiments on nonparticulate, solute-driven density currents were run to investigate the cause of abrupt transitions. Abrupt transitions occur in laboratory currents with Reynolds numbers (Re) less than 1000 and are interpreted, supported by theoretical scaling analysis, to signify a change in dynamic regime. Currents with high Re, which do not show abrupt transitions, undergo a downstream change in dynamic regime from (1) inertial slumping to (2) inertial-buoyancy spreading to (3) viscous-buoyancy spreading. In low Re currents that undergo abrupt transitions, however, the duration of the second regime is very short, and hence they appear to pass directly from the quickly moving slumping phase into the slowly moving viscous phase. Scaling analysis indicates that an abrupt transition should occur in currents below a critical value of Re of 10-5000 for currents with different initial aspect ratios. Given that natural flows typically have greater Reynolds numbers, we suggest that abrupt transitions in laboratory and natural currents are likely to be dynamically different. This work has important implications for the physical modeling of gravity flows.},

  abstract = {A recent 35-year endpoint shoreline change analysis revealed significant counterclockwise rotations occurring in north-central Oregon, USA, littoral cells that extend 10s of kilometers in length. While the potential for severe El Ni\~nos to contribute to littoral cell rotations at seasonal to interannual scale was previously recognized, the dynamics resulting in persistent (multidecadal) rotation were unknown, largely due to a lack of historical wave conditions extending back multiple decades and the difficulty of separating the timescales of shoreline variability in a high energy region. This study addresses this question by (1) developing a statistical downscaling framework to characterize wave conditions relevant for longshore sediment transport during data-poor decades and (2) applying a one-line shoreline change model to quantitatively assess the potential for such large embayed beaches to rotate. A climate INdex was optimized to capture variability in longshore wave power as a proxy for potential LOngshore Sediment Transport (LOST\_IN), and a procedure was developed to simulate many realizations of potential wave conditions from the index. Waves were transformed dynamically with Simulating Waves Nearshore to the nearshore as inputs to a one-line model that revealed shoreline rotations of embayed beaches at multiple time and spatial scales not previously discernible from infrequent observations. Model results indicate that littoral cells respond to both interannual and multidecadal oscillations, producing comparable shoreline excursions to extreme El Ni\~no winters. The technique quantitatively relates morphodynamic forcing to specific climate patterns and has the potential to better identify and quantify coastal variability on timescales relevant to a changing climate. Plain Language Summary The global climate forces large atmospheric weather patterns which in turn create the ocean waves ultimately responsible for erosion at the coastline. As the global climate changes, so too can long-term trends in coastal erosion. We have developed a technique to directly relate weather patterns to coastal change resulting from the transport of sediment along beaches and applied the method to investigate shoreline change trends in Oregon, USA, from the 1950s to the present. Counter to previous understanding, climate change on the timescale of multiple decades is responsible for which municipalities in Oregon experience persistent erosion hazards. The technique revealed the importance of large-scale climate in changing storm tracks approaching Oregon across the North Pacific. The technique developed for identifying climate patterns relevant to local coastal dynamics could be a useful predictive tool for understanding how the coast may evolve on timescales relevant for coastal managers into the 21st century.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses how the geometrical parameters (ambient ocean depth, H; bottom slope, \&\#945;) of coastal bathymetry affect the evolution of buoyant coastal currents flowing over a sloping continental shelf. Scaling arguments are presented that show the coastal current dynamics can be classified by a two-variable nondimensional parameter space: the ambient depth parameter, h/H, and the bottom slope parameter, R/yb. The ratio h/H is the fraction of the available depth occupied by the buoyant layer; the bottom slope parameter is the ratio of two horizontal length scales, the internal Rossby radius R to the bottom-trapped width yb. The scale depth h is derived from geostrophic dynamics and is representative of the depth of the buoyant layer of the coastal current. The resulting parameter space is delineated by surface-advected currents that do not depend upon the bottom slope parameter and bottom-trapped currents that do. For bottom-trapped coastal currents, the across-shore width and downstream velocities are dependent upon the magnitude of the bottom slope parameter, R/yb. The bottom slope parameter is also a ratio of the buoyant layer isopycnal slope to the shelf slope. Experiments are conducted in the laboratory in order to test the scaling. Measurements of coastal current width and nose velocities are taken, together with mean density cross sections, for a number of coastal currents. Experimental observations and oceanic datasets are examined in terms of the proposed scaling arguments; it is shown that these experimental measurements and oceanic observations are in accord.},

Significant fluctuations occur with periods of 3\textendash 20 days (Gulf Stream meanders) and weeks to months (Gulf Stream path shifts). Interannual variations in annual average power occur because of year-to-year changes in these WBC motions. No large-scale turbines presently exist, and the road to establishing MHK facilities in WBCs will encounter challenges that are similar in many aspects to those associated with the development of offshore wind power.},

  abstract = {Hydrographic and current profiler data taken during the 1988 Gulf of Cadiz Expedition have been analyzed to diagnose the mixing, spreading, and descent of the Mediterranean outflow. The u-S properties and the thickness and width of the outflow were similar to that seen in earlier surveys. The transport of pure Mediterranean Water (i.e., water with S {$>$}= 38.4 psu) was estimated to be about 0.4 3 106 m3 s21, which is lower than historical estimates-most of which were indirect-but comparable to other recent estimates made from direct velocity observations. The outflow transport estimated at the west end of the Strait of Gibraltar was about 0.7 3 106 m3 s21 of mixed water, and the transport increased to about 1.9 3 106 m3 s21 within the eastern Gulf of Cadiz. This increase in transport occurred by entrainment of fresher North Atlantic Central Water, and the salinity anomaly of the outflow was consequently reduced. The velocity.weighted salinity decreased to 36.7 psu within 60 km of the strait and decreased by about another 0.1 before the deeper portion of the outflow began to separate from of the bottom near Cape St. Vincent. Entrainment appears to have been correlated spatially with the initial descent of the continental slope and with the occurrence of bulk Froude numbers slightly greater than 1. In the western Gulf of Cadiz, where entrainment was much weaker, Froude numbers were consistently well below 1. The outflow began in the eastern Strait of Gibraltar as a narrow (10 km wide) current having a very narrow range of u\dbend S properties. The outflow broadened as it descended the continental slope of the northern Gulf of Cadiz and reached a maximum width of 80 km in the western Gulf of Cadiz. The descent of the outflow was very asymmetric: The southern (offshore) edge of the outflow descended about 1000 m from Gibraltar to Cape St. Vincent, while the northern (onshore) edge of the outflow descended only a few hundred meters. The northern, onshore side thus remained considerably higher in the water column and thus entrained relatively warm North Atlantic Central Water. This caused the outflow to develop horizontal u-S variability and, by about 140 km downstream, the across-stream variation in temperature on an isopycnal was more than 28C. Much of the volume transport in the western Gulf of Cadiz was contained within two preferred modes or cores. The deeper, offshore core had a central su 5 27.8 kg m23, and the shallower onshore core, which was still in contact with the bottom in the Gulf of Cadiz, had a central su 5 27.5 kg m23. These two cores develop as a result of the spreading and horizontally varying entrainment noted above, combined with topographic steering.},

  abstract = {Field data taken in the Gulf of Cadiz have been analyzed to describe some aspects of the momentum and energy balance of the Mediterranean outflow. A crucial component of the momentum balance is the total stress (entrainment stress and bottom drag), which has been estimated from a form of the Bernoulli function evaluated from density and current observations. For the first 60 km west of the Camarinal Sill the outflow was confined within a narrow channel on the continental shelf. At about 70 km downstream the outflow crossed over the shelf\dbend slope break and began to descend the continental slope. The buoyancy force increased substantially, and the outflow underwent a geostrophic adjustment, albeit one heavily influenced by mixing and dissipation. The current direction turned 90 degrees to the right at a near-inertial rate. In this region, the estimated geostrophic velocity greatly underestimated the actual current, and the estimated curvature Rossby number was about 0.5. Current speeds were in excess of 1 m s21 and the total stress was as large as 5 Pa. The entrainment stress, estimated independently from property fluxes, reached a maximum of about 1 Pa, or considerably smaller than the inferred bottom stress. By about 130 km downstream, the current was aligned approximately along the local topography. The current amplitude and the estimated stress were then much less, about 0.3 m s21 and 0.3 Pa. The entrainment stress was also very small in this region well downstream of the strait. This slightly damped geostrophic flow continued on to Cape St. Vincent where the outflow began to separate from the bottom. Bottom stress thus appears to be a crucial element in the dynamics of the Mediterranean outflow, allowing or causing the outflow to descend more than a kilometer into the North Atlantic. In the regions of strongest bottom stress the inferred drag coefficient was about 2 2 12 (3 10 23) depending upon which outflow speed is used in the usual quadratic form. Entrainment stress was small by comparison to the bottom stress, but the entrainment effect upon the density anomaly was crucial in eroding the density anomaly of the outflow. The observed entrainment rate appears to follow, roughly, a critical internal Froude number function.},

Stakeholders can utilize these enhanced-resolution data to investigate climate- and weather-related phenomena in Alaska. Temperature and precipitation are analyzed and compared among ERA-Interim, WRF Model downscaling, and in situ observations. Relative to ERA-Interim, the downscaling is shown to improve the spatial representation of temperature and precipitation around Alaska's complex terrain. Improvements include increased winter and decreased summer higher-elevation downscaled seasonal average temperatures. Precipitation is also enhanced over higher elevations in all seasons relative to the reanalysis. These spatial distributions of temperature and precipitation are consistent with the few available gridded observational datasets that account for topography. The downscaled precipitation generally exceeds observationally derived estimates in all seasons over mainland Alaska, and it is less than observations in the southeast. Temperature biases tended to be more mixed, and the downscaling reduces absolute bias at higher elevations, especially in winter. Careful selection of data for local site analysis from the downscaling can help to reduce these biases, especially those due to inconsistencies in elevation. Improved meteorological station coverage at higher elevations will be necessary to better evaluate gridded downscaled products in Alaska because biases vary and may even change sign with elevation.},

The study conducted a multi-model analysis that used co-optimized generation and transmission expansion planning and production cost modeling. Four transmission designs under eight scenarios were developed and studied to estimate costs and potential benefits. The results show benefit-to-cost ratios that reach as high as 2.9, indicating significant value to increasing the transmission capacity between the interconnections under the cases considered, realized through sharing generation resources and flexibility across regions.},

  abstract = {Although it can be complex to integrate variable renewable energy sources such as wind power and photovoltaics into an energy system, the potential benefits are large, as it can help reduce fuel imports, balance the trade, and mitigate the negative impacts in terms of climate change. In order to try to integrate a very large share of variable renewable energy sources into the energy system, an integrated energy planning approach was used, including ice storage in the cooling sector, a smart charging option in the transport sector, and an excess capacity of reverse osmosis technology that was utilised in order to provide flexibility to the energy system. A unit commitment and economic dispatch tool (PLEXOS) was used, and the model was run with both 5 min and 1 h time resolutions. The case study was carried out for a typical Caribbean island nation, based on data derived from measured data from Aruba. The results showed that 78.1\% of the final electricity demand in 2020 was met by variable renewable energy sources, having 1.0\% of curtailed energy in the energy system. The total economic cost of the modelled energy system was similar to the current energy system, dominated by the fossil fuel imports. The results are relevant for many populated islands and island nations.},

It is based on the one-dimensional reduced-gravity shallow-watertheory generalized to a three-dimensional orography with moderate streamwisevariations by introducing a variable effective flow cross-section. In this way,the hydraulic jump and gap flow are accommodated within the same model. Theresulting steady hyperbolic problem is shown to require the boundaryconditions to be expressed in terms of Riemann invariants. The latter yield the flow betweentwo given sites in a unique way. In particular, it is possible to relateunambiguously the existence of a hydraulic jump/gap flow and its energydiscontinuity to the boundary conditions. A simple method of flow interpolationand energy discontinuity calculation between two sites is presented.}

  abstract = {Abstract This paper describes two methods for computing direct covariance fluxes from anemometers mounted on moving platforms at sea. These methods involve the use of either a strapped-down or gyro-stabilized system that are used to compute terms that correct for the 1) instantaneous tilt of the anemometer due to the pitch, roll, and heading variations of the platform; 2) angular velocities at the anemometer due to rotation of the platform about its local coordinate system axes; and 3) translational velocities of the platform with respect to a fixed frame of reference. The paper provides a comparison of fluxes computed with three strapped-down systems from two recent field experiments. These comparisons shows that the direct covariance fluxes are in good agreement with fluxes derived using the bulk aerodynamic method. Additional comparisons between the ship system and the research platform FLIP indicate that flow distortion systematically increases the momentum flux by 15\%. Evidence suggests that this correction is appropriate for a commonly used class of research vessels. The application of corrections for both motion contamination and flow distortion results in direct covariance flux estimates with an uncertainty of approximately 10\%\^a¬Ä¬ì20\%.}

Two cases are considered: gravity currents propagating along a rigid boundary and intrusive gravity currents. For the first case, a semi-empirical formula for the front propagation speed derived from simple energy arguments is shown to capture well the effect of flow deceleration because of viscous dissipation. In the second case, the propagation speed is shown to agree with the one predicted for energy-conserving virtually inviscid flows (Shin, Dalziel \& Linden, J. Fluid Mech. vol. 521, 2004, p. 1), which implies that the losses due to vorticity generation and mixing at the liquid liquid interface play only a minor role in the total balance of energy.}

In this paper wave spectrum parameters related to transport, distribution and variability of wave energy in the sea are educed. Many different types of wave-energy converters, of various categories, have been proposed. It is useful to think of primary conversion of wave energy by an oscillating system as a wave-interference phenomenon. Corresponding to optimum wave interference, there is an upper bound to the amount of energy that can be extracted from a wave by means of a particular oscillating system. Taking physical limitations into account, another upper bound, for the ratio of extracted energy to the volume of the immersed oscillating system, has been derived. Finally, the significance of the two different upper bounds is discussed.},

  abstract = {AbstractAn internally recording, autonomous instrument has been tested for measurements of ocean turbulence from a mooring line. Measurements were made at a single level in the water column, but for an extended period of time, at a predetermined duty cycle. The instrument is designed to measure, independently, in two different parts of the turbulence wavenumber spectrum: eddy correlation measurements in the inertial subrange and small-scale shear and temperature gradient measurements in the dissipation subrange using shear probes and fast-response thermistors. For the deployment reported here, the instrument is located in the wave-affected layer, and only the dissipation subrange from the shear probes can be confidently utilized for turbulence measurements. The velocity spectra in the inertial subrange are severely contaminated by platform motion and noise, and the dissipation range of the temperature gradient spectrum is not satisfactorily resolved. The shear spectra are found to be relatively free of contamination in the 1¬ñ20-Hz frequency range and are used for dissipation rate calculations. The quality of the measurements is constrained by the angle of attack and the magnitude of mean flow relative to the wave oscillatory velocities. Dissipation rates are consistent with a scaling expected from breaking long waves, when background shear is weak, and are elevated when the gradient Richardson number is small, consistent with additional turbulence production by shear. While limited to a single depth, the instrument makes it possible to collect time series for 3 weeks continuously or for 3 months at a 25\% duty cycle.}

It is shown, through theoretical development and laboratory experimentation, that two consecutive unsteady regimes characterized by different dynamic balances are traversed as the flow approaches a steady state.}

  abstract = {Detailed wave energy resource assessments are necessary for the planning and design of wave energy converters. The waves in the U.S. Pacific Northwest have been identified as very energetic making this coast potentially suitable for wave energy harvesting. Several efforts to harvest this resource are under way in this region, however no long term, high resolution description of the resource is presently available. Here, the results of a 7 year hindcast are presented at a 30 arc-second resolution using the numerical models WAVEWATCH III and SWAN. The hindcast accuracy was quantified by comparing to measured buoy data yielding linear correlation coefficients w0.90 for the significant wave height. This study describes the alongshore variability of the resource over the continental shelf. The general decline of the wave power with depth is explained by considerations of wave refraction and shoaling. Further, due to wave refraction, areas off the central and southwest Oregon coast are identified that show increased wave power at 50 m of water in comparison with the 250 m value. These areas also show increased temporal variability. In addition, areas with preferentially narrower wave spectra in both frequency and direction are identified off southwest Oregon. Further, general trends in the directionality of the resource indicate a systematic switch in the wave direction with latitude. The seasonality of the resource is also assessed in terms of variability and trends relevant to the planning and deployment of wave energy converters. The continental shelf is mapped in terms of the coefficient of variability, which is greater (smaller) than unity during the summer (winter) and regardless of the season smaller in southwest Oregon.},

The quality of the raw data is tested by analyzing the turbulent kinetic energy frequency spectra, the turbulence spatial structure function, the shear in the profiles, and the covariance Reynolds stresses. The five-beam configuration allows for a direct estimation of the Reynolds stresses from along-beam velocity fluctuations. The Nortek's low Doppler noise and high sampling frequency allow for the observation of the turbulent inertial subrange in both the frequency spectra and the turbulence structure function. The turbulence parameters obtained from the five-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers are validated with turbulence data from simultaneous measurements with acoustic Doppler velocimeters. These combined results are then used to assess a turbulent kinetic energy budget in which depth profiles of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and production rates are compared. The associated codes are publicly available on the MATLAB File Exchange website.},

  abstract = {Ocean basin scale wind-driven currents provide a possible source of renewable energy using ocean turbine technology to convert kinetic energy of the flow to electricity. The Gulf Stream System in the North Atlantic Ocean is part of one of the largest subtropical gyres in the world. Within these gyres, the western intensification due to the Coriolis force produces some of the largest and most persistent ocean currents. This chapter discusses the potential for generating energy from the Gulf StreamGulf StreamSystem with a particular focus on the Florida Current portion. The overall characteristics related to the energy potential of the Gulf Stream are described based on 7~years of model simulations and 30~years of volume flux observations across the Florida Straits. Within the Florida Current portion of the Gulf Stream System, the mean kinetic power is found to be over 22 GW with a standard deviation near 6 GW. However, this variability was found to be contained within the top 100~m of the water column. Assessments based on the undisturbed flow indicate that deployment on the order of 5000 turbines could average over 5 GW of power. To quantify the effects of the energy extractionEnergy extractionon the circulation to obtain a better estimate of the available power, idealized and realistic modeling of the ocean circulation are presented. The idealized model indicates that a mean of 5 GW of power could be dissipated within the Florida Straits, with much more power dissipated if broader regions are considered for energy extraction. However, the practical constraints on ocean current energy extraction, such as the acceptable range of impacts on the flow as seen in a realistic 3D ocean model simulation, lead to a reduction in the assessment of the power available.},

Aiming to support all stakeholders in Australia's emerging wave energy industry, this study presents a revised assessment of Australia's national wave energy resource. The assessment is based on a state-of-the-art global wave hindcast, with higher resolution in the Australian region. Validation of the hindcast relative to in-situ wave buoy and satellite altimeter observations show better comparison than prior assessments. The total nationally available resource is similar in magnitude to earlier studies, but regional differences are evident. The total integrated energy flux across the 200 m contour is approximately 2730 TWh/yr, with estimates of resource along the north and eastern coasts being less than previously estimated. This revised pre-competitive resource information is delivered coincidently with marine management and alternative use (constraint layers), and energy infrastructure, spatial information via the open-access Australian Wave Energy Atlas (AWavEA), served through the Australian Renewable Energy Infrastructure (AREMI). The Atlas serves to reduce barriers to emergence of an Australian wave energy industry.},

  abstract = {The effects of resistive forces on unsteady shallow flows over rigid horizontal boundaries are investigated theoretically. The dynamics of this type of motion are driven by the streamwise gradient of the hydrostatic pressure, which balances the inertia of the fluid and the basal resistance. Drag forces are often negligible provided the fluid is sufficiently deep. However, close to the front of some flows where the depth of the moving layer becomes small, it is possible for drag to substantially influence the motion. Here we consider three aspects of unsteady shallow flows. First we consider a regime in which the drag, inertia and buoyancy (pressure gradient) are formally of the same magnitude throughout the entire current and we construct a new class of similarity solutions for the motion. This reveals the range of solution types possible, which includes those with continuous profiles, those with discontinuous profiles and weak shocks and those which are continuous but have critical points of transition at which the gradients may be discontinuous. Next we analyse one-dimensional dam-break flow and calculate how drag slows the motion. There is always a region close to the front in which drag forces are not negligible. We employ matched asymptotic expansions to combine the flow at the front with the flow in the bulk of the domain and derive theoretical predictions that are compared to laboratory measurements of dam-break flows. Finally we investigate a modified form of dam-break flow in which the vertical profile of the horizontal velocity field is no longer assumed to be uniform. It is found that in the absence of drag it is no longer possible to find a kinematically consistent front of the fluid motion. However the inclusion of drag forces within the region close to the front resolves this difficulty. We calculate velocity and depth profiles within the drag-affected region, and obtain the leading-order expression for the rate at which the fluid propagates when the magnitude of the drag force is modelled using Ch\dbend zy, Newtonian and power-law fluid closures; this compares well with experimental data and provide new insights into dam-break flows.}

  abstract = {Experiments are reported on the sustained release of saline and particle-laden fluid into a long, but relatively narrow, flume, filled with fresh water. The dense fluid rapidly spread across the flume and flowed away from the source: the motion was then essentially two-dimensional. In the absence of a background flow in the flume, the motion was symmetric, away from the source. However, in the presence of a background flow the upstream speed of propagation was slowed and the downstream speed was increased. Measurements of this motion are reported and, when the excess density was due to the presence of suspended sediment, the distribution of the deposited particles was also determined. Alongside this experimental programme, new theoretical models of the motion were developed. These were based upon multi-layered depth-averaged shallow-water equations, in which the interfacial drag and mixing processes were explicitly modelled. While the early stages of the motion are independent of these interfacial phenomena to leading order, they play an increasingly important dynamical role as the the flow is slowed, or even arrested. In addition a new integral model is proposed. This does not resolve the interior dynamics of the flow, but may be readily integrated and obviates the need for more lengthy numerical calculations. It is shown that the predictions from both the shallow-layer and integral models are in close agreement with the experimental observations.}

  abstract = {The influence of drag on the motion of gravity currents over rigid horizontal surfaces is considered analytically using a Ch\dbend zy model of boundary shear stress. Although the initial motion is governed by a balance between the buoyancy forces and fluid inertia, drag gradually influences the flow. The length and time scales at which these effects become significant are identified. A perturbation series, valid at early times, is constructed to analyse the changes to the velocity and height of the evolving current due to drag. At much later times, a new class of similarity solutions is developed to model the motion which is now governed by a balance between buoyancy and drag. The transition in the dominant forces which govern the dynamics of the flow is examined by numerically integrating the equations of motion for flows generated by a constant flux of relatively dense fluid. The numerical results confirm both the perturbation solution, valid at early times, and the new similarity solution valid at late times. The transition between the two may involve the formation of a discontinuity (bore). Finally particle-driven currents, which exhibit different dynamical behaviour due to the progressive reduction of their density arising from particle sedimentation, are investigated.}

The new feature of these numerical experiments is that diapycnal mixing is idealized as strong bottom-intensified mixing on both sides of the midocean ridge; elsewhere diapycnal mixing is set at a low background value. The bottom-intensified diapycnal mixing induces strong equatorward (poleward) flow along the western (eastern) slope of the midocean ridge. In addition, the strong vertical gradient of diapycnal mixing rate induces downwelling in the basin interior and intensifies the upwelling near the axis of the midocean ridge. The strong ridge-following currents induce anticlockwise circulation in both the eastern and western deep basins, and such circulation is opposite to the classical Stommel-Arons circulation. This study indicates that bottom topography, strong mixing over the midocean ridge, and strong localized mixing associated with overflows can have major impact on the strength of the deep meridional overturning cell and deep water properties in the whole deep basin.},

Total instantaneous wave energy on the entire Australian shelf is on average 3.47 PJ.

New South Wales and southern Queensland shelves, with moderate levels of wave power (time-average: 10\textendash 20 kW m\`A1; 90th percentile: 20\textendash 30 kW m\`A1), are also potential sites for electricity generation due to them having a similar reliability in resource delivery to the southern margin. Time-average wave power for most of the northern Australian shelf is {$<$}10 kW m\`A1. Seasonal variations in wave power are consistent with regional weather patterns, which are characterised by winter SE trade winds/summer monsoon in the north and winter temperate storms/summer sea breezes in the south. The nationally consistent wave resource assessment for Australian shelf waters can be used to inform policy development and site-selection decisions by industry.},

  abstract = {The newly available SIMAR-44 data set, covering a 44-year period, is used together with wave buoy data to assess the wave energy resource along the Death Coast, the craggy stretch from Cape Finisterre to the Sisarga Isles. Its location at the north-western corner of the Iberian Peninsula and its coastline configuration result in exposure to a wide range of wave directions over the long Atlantic fetch. A total of 18 study sites are analysedd16 SIMAR-44 points and two wave buoys. Annual wave power in the Death Coast area is of the order of 50 kWm\`A1, and annual wave energy exceeds 400 MWhm\`A1. This vast resource is characterised thoroughly in terms of wave directions, heights and periods. A coastal wave propagation model (SWAN) is then implemented, validated based on wave buoy measurements, and used to investigate the nearshore energetic patterns. The irregular bathymetry of the Death Coast is shown to lead to local concentrations of wave energy off Capes Veo, Tosto and Finisterre and north of the Sisargas Isles, which are more conspicuous in winter and, especially, in storm situations.},

Each device was designed to operate in a specific marine resource, instead of a generic device that can be deployed at any location. This method allows each device to be used as a reference model to benchmark future devices. The six designs consist of three current energy converters and three wave energy converters. The reference model project has generated both technical and economic data sets that are available in the public domain. The methodology to calculate the levelized cost of energy for the reference model project and an overall comparison of the cost of energy from these six reference-model designs are presented in this paper.},

PND Engineers, Inc., deployed three bottom-mounted upward-looking Nortek Acoustic Wave and Current (AWAC) profilers near Iniskin Bay. The instruments were configured to collect current profiles and wave data alternating with experimental ``diagnostic'' water-ice interface profiles. Analyzing these measurements together with the surface current velocity time series and assumed ice block shape allows estimation of the ice block size, mass, and velocity. Descriptions of the instrumentation and data processing are presented in this paper. This mission was the first application of this recently developed technique for ice measurements in Cook Inlet's harsh environment.},

In this paper, we showcase the U.S. Department of Energy's resource characterization and assessment project. This multi-year project, conducted by three national labs, is delivering data and results designed to reduce the uncertainty, risk, and cost of marine energy technology. Over its first three years this project has: 1) completed highresolution, long-term regional wave hindcasts for the U.S. west coast, east coast, and Alaska, 2) completed highresolution tidal models of five top-ranking tidal energy sites, 3) completed resource measurements following International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) technical specifications at four wave energy sites and four tidal energy sites, and 4) developed wave classification schemes. The project has been guided by an international steering committee composed of industry partners and academic experts. As the project moves toward completion the team will: complete high-resolution modelling for all U.S. coastal waters, complete resource measurements at top-ranking sites, refine the national resource assessments, propose classification schemes to the IEC standards body, and upgrade the Marine and Hydrokinetic (MHK) Atlas to make the project's data public and accessible. These data and tools can be used for: device design processes for technology developers, economic assessments for project developers, energy assessments (power supply and energy portfolio diversification) for regional planners and policy makers, operational reliability and economic assessments for utilities and investors, and baseline data for environmental impacts studies needed by regulatory agencies.},

  abstract = {AbstractAcoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADVs) are a valuable tool for making high-precision measurements of turbulence, and moorings are a convenient and ubiquitous platform for making many kinds of measurements in the ocean. However, because of concerns that mooring motion can contaminate turbulence measurements and that acoustic Doppler profilers make middepth velocity measurements relatively easy, ADVs are not frequently deployed from moorings. This work demonstrates that inertial motion measurements can be used to reduce motion contamination from moored ADV velocity measurements. Three distinct mooring platforms were deployed in a tidal channel with inertial-motion-sensor-equipped ADVs. In each case, motion correction based on the inertial measurements reduces mooring motion contamination of velocity measurements. The spectra from these measurements are consistent with other measurements in tidal channels and have an slope at high frequencies?consistent with Kolmogorov?s theory of isotropic turbulence. Motion correction also improves estimates of cross spectra and Reynolds stresses. A comparison of turbulence dissipation with flow speed and turbulence production indicates a bottom boundary layer production?dissipation balance during ebb and flood that is consistent with the strong tidal forcing at the site. These results indicate that inertial-motion-sensor-equipped ADVs are a valuable new tool for making high-precision turbulence measurements from moorings.}

We found that dissipation had a structure that tended to increase the diffusivity near the sea floor, and with distance from the ridge crest. A weak spring-neap cycle was found, with dissipation changing by a factor of two, or approximately linearly with the tidal velocities. A kinematic relationship between the internal tide energy and the depth integrated dissipation was found so that the dissipation was proportional to the square root of the energy. This relation is corroborated by a simple "knife-edge" model and wave\_wave interaction theory. The observed dissipation is extrapolated along the ridge to give a rough estimate of the dissipation near 7.5+/-3 GW.},

  abstract = {Strong internal waves (IW) in the form of soliton groups were observed off the Oregon coast with in situ and remote sensors, including shore-based X band and Ka band Doppler radars and an airborne microwave radiometer operating at 37 GHz. Here we analyze the relationships between oceanic isotherm vertical displacements, internal currents, and radar backscatter cross sections, along with Doppler velocity signals at horizontal (HH) and vertical (VV) polarizations, and 37-GHz brightness temperatures measured at intermediate incidence angles from an airship. Analysis of these observations shows that (1) the horizontal spatial structure of the IW field depends on whether it is forced by a strong (spring) tide or weak (neap) tide; (2) while both HH and VV are strongly modulated by IWs, the modulation depth of HH always exceeds that of VV, and they both increase with the IW amplitude; (3) 37-GHz brightness temperature modulations were in phase with radar signal modulations; and (4) the phase of radar signal modulation with respect to the IW is such that the minimum radar signal intensity and lowest microwave brightness temperature lie close to the maximum of the IW thermocline depression or, equivalently, the horizontal current excursion near the surface. This last observation conflicts with the expectation that the highest backscattered signal would be found near the region of greatest surface strain rate (the surface current gradient). Existing theoretical models are briefly reviewed for interactions between the IW field and the intensity of short gravity-capillary waves that might be responsible for this behavior.},

  abstract = {As a renewable energy, the assessment of wave power potential around a country is crucial. Knowledge of the temporal and spatial variations of wave energy is required for locating a wave power plant. This study investigates the variations in wave power at 19 locations covering the Indian shelf seas using the ERA-Interim dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The ERA-Interim data is compared with the measured wave parameters in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Along the western shelf seas of India, the seasonal oscillations lead to variation of the wave power from the lowest seasonal mean value (2.6 kW/m) in the post-monsoon period (OctobereJanuary) to the highest value (25.9 kW/m) in the south-west monsoon (JuneeSeptember) period. Significant (10 e20\%) inter-annual variations are detected at few locations. The mean annual wave power along the eastern Indian shelf seas (2.6e9.9 kW/m) is lower than the mean annual wave power along the western part (7.9e11.3 kW/m). The total annual mean wave power available along the western shelf seas of India is around 19.5 GW. Along the eastern shelf seas, it is around 8.7 GW. In the Indian Shelf seas, the annual mean wave power is highest (11.3 kW/m) at the southern location (location 11), and the seasonal variation in wave power is also less. Hence, location 11 is a better location for a wave power plant in the Indian shelf seas.},

  abstract = {Flows between ocean basins are often controlled by narrow channels and shallow sills. A multi-layer hydraulic control theory is developed for exchange flow through such constrictions. The theory is based on the inviscid shallow-water equations and extends the functional approach introduced by Gill (1977) and developed by Dalziel (1991). The flows considered are those in rectangular cross-section channels connecting two large reservoirs, with a single constriction (sill and/or narrows). The exchange flow depends on the stratification in the two reservoirs, represented as a finite number of immiscible layers of (different) uniform density. For most cases the flow is `controlled' at the constriction and often at other points along the channel (virtual controls) too. As with one- and two-layer hydraulics, controls are locations at which the flow passes from one solution branch to another, and at which (at least) one internal wave mode is stationary. The theory is applied to three-layer flows, which have two internal wave modes, predicting interface heights and layer fluxes from the given reservoir conditions. The theoretical results for three-layer flows are compared to a comprehensive set of laboratory experiments and found to give good agreement. The laboratory experiments also show other features of the flow, such as the formation of waves on the interfaces. The implications of the results for oceanographic flows and ocean modelling are discussed.}

  abstract = {The overturning circulation of the ocean plays an important role in modulating the Earth's climate. But whereas the mechanisms for the vertical transport of water into the deep ocean - deep water formation at high latitudes and horizontal transport in ocean currents have been largely identifed, it is not clear how the compensating vertical transport of water from the depths to the surface is accomplished. Turbulent mixing across surfaces of constant density is the only viable mechanism for reducing the density of the water and enabling it to rise. However, measurements of the internal wave field, the main source of energy for mixing, and of turbulent dissipation rates, have typically implied diffusivities across surfaces of equal density of only ,0.1 cm2 s-1, too small to account for the return \dbend ow. Here we report measurements of tracer dispersion and turbulent energy dissipation in the Brazil basin that reveal diffusivities of 2+/-4 cm2 s-1 at a depth of 500m above abyssal hills on the \dbend ank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and approximately 10 cm2 s-1 nearer the bottom. This amount of mixing, probably driven by breaking internal waves that are generated by tidal currents \dbend owing over the rough bathymetry, may be large enough to close the buoyancy budget for the Brazil basin and suggests a mechanism for closing the global overturning circulation.},

  abstract = {Recent idealized studies have shown that both explicit horizontal diffusion and the implicit diffusion associated with the advection scheme in high-resolution z-coordinate models may drive unrealistically high rates of diapycnal mixing. The aim here is to see whether the diapycnal mixing associated with the advection scheme in a global eddy-permitting (\dbend 8 by \dbend 8) z-level model is sufficiently strong to corrupt the thermohaline circulation. This paper diagnoses the diapycnal fluxes by using the ideas of water mass transformation. In the Southern Ocean, the model deep and bottom waters drift rapidly away from the Levitus climatology, with dense isopycnals moving downward at rates of up to 35 m yr21. The strong upward flux (up to 50 Sv) through the dense isopycnals cannot be explained by the incorrect surface forcing (as a result of poor surface fluxes and no ice model) as most of the anomalous diapycnal fluxes are occurring in the deep ocean far from surface forcing. Hence, the excessive diapycnal flux is driven by diffusion in the model, both explicit and implicit. The "effective" diapycnic diffusivity driven by the numerical diffusion (associated with the horizontal advection scheme) is found to be the same order, 1-10 cm2 s21, as that driven by the explicit horizontal diffusion. For strong vertical velocities (;20 m day21) as in models forced by high frequency winds, the vertical advection scheme also gives similar effective diffusivities. These effective diffusivities are considerably greater than suggested by observations. To alleviate these problems, it is suggested that eddy-resolving z-level climate models will require 1) less diffusive horizontal advection schemes and 2) better vertical resolution throughout much of the water column.},

It was observed that a wind-driven anticlockwise diurnal-period vertical mode one Kelvin wave generated large scale motions within the water column, and that the interactions between this wave and the sloping lakebed induced TBBLs. A simple model, based on potential energy change and boundary shearing, was shown to describe the mean TBBL thickness.}

Three basic regimes were observed depending on the strength of the wind. For weak wind stresses (from -0.02 to 0.02 Pa), the buoyant coastal current was relatively thin, the front slope was not steep, and the width was variable (1\dbend 20 km). For moderate downwelling (southward) wind stresses (0.02\dbend{} 0.07 Pa), wind-driven cross-shelf advection steepened the front, causing the plume to narrow and thicken. For stronger downwelling wind stresses (greater than 0.07 Pa), vertical mixing dominated, bulk Richardson numbers were approximately 0.25, isopycnals were nearly vertical, and the plume front widened but the plume width did not change. Plume thickness and width were normalized by the theoretical plume scales in the absence of wind forcing. Normalized plume thickness increased linearly from 1 to 2 as downwelling wind stresses increased from 0 to 0.2 Pa. Normalized plume widths were approximately 1 for downwelling wind stresses from 0.02 to 0.2 Pa. The observed along-shelf propagation speed of the plume was roughly equal to the sum of the theoretical propagation speed and the wind-driven along-shelf flow.}

The same result holds in strongly stratified situations as long as the generated disturbances in the neighborhood of the head do not propagate away. Classical density currents occur in weak stratification, multiheaded density currents in intermediate stratification, and multiheaded density currents with solitary wave\&\#8211;like or borelike disturbances propagating ahead of the current in strong stratification.In the second case, the upper-layer stratification consistently reduces the density-current height and its propagation speed. The simulated system resembles laboratory density currents and is not much affected by the overlying stratification.Finally, in continuously stratified flow, the effect of stratification is similar to the second case. The density current becomes shallower and moves more slowly as the stratification is increased. The modeled system has the basic features of density currents if the stratification is weak or moderate, but it becomes progressively less elevated as stratification increases. In strong stratification the density current assumes a wedgelike structure.The simulation results are compared with the authors\&\#8217; previously obtained analytical results, and the physical mechanisms for the effect of stratification are discussed.}

The nested model system comprises structured WAVEWATCH III for the globe and unstructured SWAN around the Hawaiian Islands with wind forcing from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis and its regional downscaling. The development effort follows the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards. The hindcast is first validated with buoy measurements in terms of the six IEC wave energy resources parameters. The comparison shows good overall agreement but with greater uncertainties for some of the parameters intended for narrowband spectra. The multimodal sea state of Hawaii includes a mix of short-period wind seas, long-period north and south swells as well as waves with moderate periods from multiple sources. We partition the hindcast spectra based on the respective period ranges and directions and validate the partitioned spectral energy and parameters with measured values. The partitioned hindcast spectra allow separate seasonal descriptions of dominate components from wind seas to swells for in-depth understanding of the wave climate and proper categorization of wave energy resources in terms of the six IEC parameters for Hawaii.},

  abstract = {Laboratory experiments were performed in which an intrusive gravity current was observed using shadowgraph and particle tracking methods. The intrusion was generated in a two-layer fluid with a sharp interface by mixing the fluid behind a vertical lock gate and then suddenly withdrawing the gate from the tank. The purpose of the experiments was to determine the structure of the velocity field inside the intrusion and the stability characteristics of the interface. Soon after the removal of the lock gate, the front of the intrusive gravity current travelled at a constant speed close to the value predicted by theory for an energy-conserving gravity current. The observed structure of the flow inside the intrusion can be divided into three regions. At the front of the intrusion there is an energy-conserving head region in which the fluid velocity is nearly uniform with speed equal to the front speed. This is followed by a dissipative wake region in which large billows are present with their associated mixing and in which the fluid velocity is observed to be non-uniform and have a maximum speed approximately 50\% greater than the front speed. Behind the wake region is a tail region in which there is very little mixing and the velocity field is nearly uniform with a speed slightly faster than the front speed.}

  abstract = {The adjustment of estuarine circulation and density to changes in river flow and tidal mixing is investigated using analytical and numerical models. Tidally averaged momentum and salinity equations in a rectangular estuary are vertically averaged over two levels, resulting in equations that are analytically tractable while retaining a broad range of time-dependent behavior. It is found that both strongly stratified and well-mixed estuaries respond rapidly to either type of forcing change, while those of intermediate stratification respond more slowly. Intermediate estuaries also have the greatest sensitivity to change. Exchange flow dominates the up-estuary salt flux in strongly stratified cases. Changing the river flow in such cases leads to an internal wave propagating the length of the estuary, which accomplishes much of the adjustment. The internal wave speed thus controls the adjustment time. Increased tidal mixing in strongly stratified cases initially decreases the exchange flow contribution to up-estuary salt flux by decreasing both the stratification and the vertical current shear. However, the decreased up-estuary salt flux leads to a loss of total salt in the estuary, and hence a greater longitudinal salinity gradient. The increasing gradient eventually restores the exchange-flow salt flux to near its original value.Well-mixed solutions have an advective\dbend diffusive balance between river flow and longitudinal tidal mixing. In these cases the adjustment time corresponds to the time it takes the depth-averaged flow to travel the length scale of the salt intrusion, a result that applies to both types of changes considered In all cases the adjustment depends upon the dynamical feedback between the longitudinal salt flux and the longitudinal salinity gradient, which varies as the estuary gains or loses total salt.}

  abstract = {An extension to the energy-conserving theory of gravity currents in rectangular rotating channels is presented, in which an upstream potential vorticity boundary condition in the current is applied. It is assumed that the fluid is inviscid; that the Boussinesq approximation applies; that the fundamental properties of momentum, energy, volume flux and potential vorticity are conserved between upstream and downstream locations; and that the flow is dissipationless. The upstream potential vorticity in the current is set through the introduction of a new parameter delta, that defines the ratio of the reference depth of the current to the ambient fluid. Flow types are established as a function delta and the rotation rate, and a fourth flow geometry is identified in addition to the three previously identified for rotating gravity currents. Detailed solutions are obtained for three cases delta = 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5, where delta {$<$} 1 is relevant to currents originating from a shallow source and delta {$>$} 1 to currents where the source region is deeper than the downstream depth, for example where a deep ocean flow encounters a plateau. The governing equations and solutions for each case are derived, quantifying the flow in terms of the depth, width and front speed. Cross-stream velocity profiles are provided for both the ambient fluid and the current. These predict the evolution of a complex circulation within the current as the rotation rate is varied. The ambient fluid exhibits similar trends to those predicted by the energy-conserving theory, with the Froude number tending to surd 2 at the right-hand wall at high rotation rates. The introduction of the potential vorticity boundary condition into the energy-conserving theory does not appear to have a substantial effect on the main flow parameters (such as current speed and width); however it does provide an insight into the complex dynamics of the flow within the current.}

  abstract = {A comprehensive energy loss theory for gravity currents in rotating rectangular channels is presented. The model is an extension of the non-rotating energy loss theory of Benjamin (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 31, 1968, p. 209) and the steady-state dissipationless theory of rotating gravity currents of Hacker (PhD thesis, 1996). The theory assumes the fluid is inviscid, there is no shear within the current, and the Boussinesq approximation is made. Dissipation is introduced using a simple method. A head loss term is introduced into the Bernoulli equation and it is assumed that the energy loss is uniform across the stream. Conservation of momentum, volume flux and potential vorticity between upstream and downstream locations is then considered. By allowing for energy dissipation, results are obtained for channels of arbitrary depth and width (relative to the current). The results match those from earlier workers in the two limits of (i) zero rotation (but including dissipation) and (ii) zero dissipation (but including rotation). Three types of flow are identified as the effect of rotation increases, characterized in terms of the location of the outcropping interface between the gravity current and the ambient fluid on the channel boundaries. The parameters for transitions between these cases are quantified, as is the detailed behaviour of the flow in all cases. In particular, the speed of the current can be predicted for any given channel depth and width. As the channel depth increases, the predicted Froude number tends to surd 2, as for non-rotating flows.}

  abstract = {We generalize the linear stability analysis of the axisymmetric self-similar solution of gravity currents from finite-volume releases to include perturbations that depend on both radial and azimuthal coordinates. We show that the similarity solution is stable to sufficiently small perturbations by proving that all perturbation eigenfunctions decay in time. Moreover, asymmetric perturbations are shown to decay more rapidly than axisymmetric perturbations in general. An asymptotic formula for the eigenvalues is derived, which indicates that asymptotic rates of decay of perturbations are given by t(-sigma) where 0 {$<$} sigma {$<$} (1)/(4) as the Froude number decreases from sqrt2 to 0. We demonstrate that this formula agrees closely with numerically calculated eigenvalues and, in the absence of azimuthal dependence, it reduces to an expression that improves on the asymptotic formula obtained by Grundy \& Rottman (1985). For two-dimensional (planar) currents, we further prove analytically that all perturbation eigenfunctions decay like t(-1/2) .}

A sensitivity analysis for different physical parameters and wave and turbulence formulations was performed. The flux of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) prescribed by wave dissipation from a numerical wave model was compared with the conventional prescription using the wind friction velocity. A surface roughness length of 0.6 times the significant wave height was proposed, and the flux of TKE was applied at a distance below the mean sea surface that is half of this roughness length. The wave enhanced layer had a total depth that is almost three times the significant wave height. In this layer the non-dimensionalized Terray scaling with power of -1.8 (instead of -2) was applicable.},

  abstract = {Steady-state analytic models establish two key points concerning the impact of vertical shear on density currents and the implication for convection initiation. First, shear decreases the horizontal convergence, and therefore the mean ascent, associated with downshear propagating currents. Second, shear has a basic effect on the dynamical organization. If the downshear current travels at the speed of the ambient flow at a critical (steering) level, an overturning circulation provides deep lifting. Although mean ascent is increased by shear in the case of upshear propagating currents, the lifting is comparatively shallow because jumplike ascent occurs rather than deep overturning. The convection initiation mechanism involving the downshear current is therefore very different from the upshear case.These basic principles are borne out in two-dimensional numerical simulations. Density currents generated by a stationary cold source imposed on an initially horizontally homogeneous, sheared, and neutrally stratified ambient flow are explored. Results show that (i) if the surface flow and low-level shear vectors are in the same direction, as in a low-level jet, the effects of shear and surface flow on the density current head height counteract one another; and (ii) if they oppose one another, as in a surface jet, both conspire to lower the density current head on the downwind side but raise it on the upwind side.As regards convection initiation by sea breezes, point (i) above shows an approximately equal but weak preference for convection exists on the leeward and windward coasts. Point (ii) shows that initiation is strongly suppressed on the windward coast, but strongly enhanced on the leeward one. The hypothesis that sea breezes are more intense in offshore flow therefore holds only if shear and surface flow have opposite sign or if the flow is unsheared.Concerning convection initiation by thunderstorm outflows, downshear propagating outflows provide the deepest lifting if they move at the speed of the ambient flow at a critical level, despite the fact that low-level convergence is decreased by shear. While shear strengthens the mean ascent in upshear propagating outflows there is no steering level to anchor the incipient convection to the organized ascent.}

  abstract = {In this study, a long-term assessment of the wave energy resource potential for the Australian southeast shelf is performed from deep to shallow water, based on a 31-year wave hindcast. The hindcast, covering the period from 1979 to 2010, has been performed at high spatio-temporal resolution with the wave energy transformation model SWAN using calibrated source-term parameters. The model has been applied with a variable spatial resolution of up to approximately 500 m and at 1 h temporal resolution and driven with high-resolution, non-stationary CFSR wind fields and full 2D spectral boundary conditions from WaveWatch III model. Model validation was conducted against wave measurements from multiple buoy sites covering 10\textendash 31 years and showed a relatively high correlation between hindcast and measured significant wave height (Hs) and mean wave direction (hm).},

The analysis covers the whole west seaside, to which a partition defined by 7 linear sections parallel to the coastline at 50 m depth was considered. Available wave energy at each linear sector was calculated from nearshore wave parameters, using as input the offshore wave conditions provided by a 15-year ocean wind-wave model simulation and considering a simplified but well-established analytical procedure for shoreward wave transformation. Two alternative measures of the nearshore wave energy resource were considered, the standard omni-directional wave power density and the more restricted normally-directed wave energy flux.},

Here, we apply the third-generation wave model SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) at high resolution to assess the wave resource of the northwest European shelf seas, an area where many wave energy test sites exist, and where many wave energy projects are under development. The model is applied to 7 years of wind forcing (2005\textendash 2011), a time period which witnessed considerable extremes in the variability of the wind (and hence wave) climate, as evidenced by the variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Our simulations demonstrate that there is much greater uncertainty in the NW European shelf wave resource during October\textendash March, in contrast to the period April\textendash September. In the more energetic regions of the NW European shelf seas, e.g. to the northwest of Scotland, the uncertainty was considerably greater. The winter NW European shelf wave power resource correlated well with the NAO. Therefore, provided trends in the NAO can be identified over the coming decades, it may be possible to estimate how the European wave resource will similarly vary over this time period. Finally, the magnitude of wave power estimated by this study is around 10\% lower than a resource which is used extensively by the wave energy sector \textendash{} the Atlas of UK Marine Renewable Energy Resources. Although this can partly be explained by different time periods analysed for each study, our application of a third-generation wave model at high spatial and spectral resolution significantly improves the representation of the physical processes, particularly the non-linear wave-wave interactions.},

We tested the therapeutic effects of homeopathic dilutions of silica on induced chronic wounds. Holes were made in the ears of mice by dental wire, which then remained hanging from the ear to cause persistent mechanical irritation. In each experiment 3 or 4 groups of 10 mice each were treated by adding homeopathic dilutions of silica (10(-10), 10(-60), 10(-400)) and of saline (10(-10), respectively, to the drinking water of the mice for 4-20 days. The size of the wound holes was measured every second day (grades 0-4) and/or by an objective image analysis system. The results showed that in 7/11 experiments the ear holes of the silica-treated animals were significantly smaller (p less than 0.05-0.001) and healed faster than in those treated with saline. Also the therapeutic effect increased progressively with increase in dilution of the silica (10(-10) less than 10(-60) less than 10(-400)). These results show that homeopathic dilutions of silica (even well beyond Avogadro's number) clearly have a therapeutic effect on wound healing and that our experimental model for studying wound healing is a very useful tool for such studies.},

  abstract = {Large-amplitude nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) are frequently observed propagat-ing away from the Columbia River tidal plume front. They are generated during the de-celeration of the frontal bulge. Cruise vessel observations indicate that in the presence of strong ambient velocity shear, the maximum amplitude of the NLIW structure function appear well below the density interface on which the NLIWs is traveling, and at a deeper depth than in the absence of shear. The Observations of NLIW properties are based on density profiles, ADCP velocities and ADCP beam echo intensity, all obtained by a towed sled during the RISE (River Influences on Shelf Ecosystems) project. The effects of ambient shear on NLIW dynamic characteristics can be analyzed using a high-order KdV model forced by an ambient velocity field described by three parameters: the sur-face layer ambient velocity (U0), the depth of the maximum ambient velocity shear (hU), and the shear depth range (thickness) {$\delta$}hU. RISE vessel data show there are two depth ranges associated with density overturns and vertical mixing. Dynamic analysis reveals that the overturns correspond to the depths with the gradient Richardson number Rig less than a critical value of 0.25. The nonlinear interaction between ambient shear and the NLIWs is responsible for velocity shear inten-sification and causes Rig to decrease below the critical value. In addition, due to the pres-ence of ambient velocity shear, the maximum NLIW velocity shear occurs at a depth be-low the interface where there is less stratification, which enhances the NLIW-induced turbulent mixing. The Rig calculated from the in-situ measurements is consistent with the results of the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract = {In this study, tidal stream energy resources of the Southwestern Sea of Korea were assessed using a numerical model, Modelo Hidrodin\^amico (MOHID). This numerical model is based on the finite volume method, which allows numerical experiments on estuaries, coasts, and oceans. For the numerical experiment, we used grid data of at least 90 m resolution by applying bathymetry data created by the Korea Institute of Ocean Science \& Technology (KIOST) and FES2012 data as a tidal boundary condition. Strong tidal currents occur in the Southwestern Sea of Korea due to the characteristics of the tidal systems of the West Sea and the South Sea, and the topographical characteristics of a Ria coast. These characteristics were appropriately reproduced by the numerical experiment. Accordingly, the average and maximum tidal currents calculated by the numerical model were used in the assessment. Two regions, Jangjuk and Maenggol-Geocha, were selected as the candidate areas for tidal stream energy development. In addition, the amounts of tidal stream energy resources were evaluated using geographical information system-based spatial analysis by applying the tidal current, depth data, and area of each region. The resource amounts were estimated to be 4,841 MW, with 5,743 tidal stream energy converters (TECs) for Jangjuk, and 3,497 MW, with 3,676 TECs for Maenggol-Geocha.},

  abstract = {The spatially developing region of a steady downslope current in transition from a hydraulically controlled, arrested wedge flow is examined through a set of laboratory experiments. The mixing and entrainment mechanisms at the shear interface are explored with the use of imaging techniques. The initial, unstable accelerating region, characterized by rapid development, low shear layer Richardson numbers and high entrainment rates, is limited by the effects of stratification which suppress the large-scale overturning. A subsequent high Richardson number region is characterized by weak entrainment and the collapse of turbulence from the initial region. The flow approaches a quasi-stable state as the mixed layer draws energy from the accelerating density current. Observed large-scale structure is attributed to an instability of the marginally unstable shear layer. Entrainment rates are calculated within each region for the various slopes considered and estimates for the extent of the transition regions are obtained.}

  abstract = {A 15-year (2004\textendash 2018) record of mooring observations from the upper 50 m ocean in the eastern Eurasian Basin reveals increased current speeds and shear, associated with an increasing coupling between wind, ice, and oceanic currents and their vertical shear over 2004\textendash 2018, particularly in summer. Substantial increases in both current speeds and shears in the upper 50 m are dominated by a two times amplification of currents in the semidiurnal band, which includes tides and wind-forced near-inertial oscillations. For the first time the strengthened upper ocean currents and shear are observed to coincide with weakening stratification. This coupling links the Atlantic Water heat to the sea ice, a consequence of which would be reducing regional sea ice volume. These results point to a new positive feedback mechanism in which reduced sea ice extent facilitates more energetic inertial oscillations and associated upper-ocean shear, thus leading in enhanced ventilation of the Atlantic water. Plain Language Summary Previous studies demonstrated that in recent years density gradients above the warm and salty intermediate (\textasciitilde 150\textendash 900 m) water of Atlantic origin in the eastern Arctic Ocean have weakened, allowing stronger upward transport heat to the bottom of the sea ice. Using mooring observations, we show that this weakening of stratification has been accompanied by stronger upper-ocean currents and their vertical shear and by increasing coupling between the wind and sea ice with upper ocean currents and shear. Most of this enhanced energy and shear is in the semidiurnal band, which includes baroclinic tides and wind-driven inertial oscillations. The increased shear together with the weakening stratification indicate a greater potential for shear-driven turbulent mixing. We propose a new process, the ice/ocean-heat positive feedback, that can accelerate current sea ice loss and impede the rate of recovery of eastern Arctic sea ice even if large-scale climate warming conditions relax.},

  abstract = {The baroclinic tides play a significant role in the energy budget of the abyssal ocean. Although the basic principles of generation and propagation are known, a clear understanding of these phenomena in the complex ocean environment is only now emerging. To advance this effort, a ray model is developed that quantifies the effects of spatially variable topography, stratification, and planetary vorticity on the horizontal propagation of internal gravity modes. The objective is to identify "baroclinic shoals" where wave energy is spatially concentrated and enhanced dissipation might be expected. The model is then extended to investigate the propagation of internal waves through a barotropic mesoscale current field. The refraction of tidally generated internal waves at the Hawaiian Ridge is examined using an ensemble of mesoscale background realizations derived from weekly Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon altimetric measurements. The path of mode 1 is only slightly affected by typical currents, although its phase becomes increasingly random as the propagation distance from the source increases. The effect of the currents becomes more dramatic as mode number increases. For modes 3 and higher, wave phase can vary between realizations by +/- \textbackslash pi only a few wavelengths from the source. This phase variability reduces the magnitude of the baroclinic signal seen in altimetric data, creating a fictitious energy loss along the propagation path. In the TOPEX/Poseidon observations, the mode-1 M2 internal tide does appear to lose significant energy as it propagates southwestward from the Hawaiian Ridge. The simulations suggest that phase modulation by mesoscale flows could be responsible for a large fraction of this apparent loss. In contrast, northeast-propagating internal tides encounter a less energetic mesoscale and should experience limited refraction. The apparent energy loss seen in the altimetric data on the north side of the ridge might indeed be real.}

  abstract = {Wind is a climate variable with major impacts on humans, ecosystems and infrastructure, especially in coastal regions with cold climates. Climate-related changes in high-wind events therefore have major implications for high-latitude residents, yet there has heretofore been no systematic evaluation of such changes in a framework spanning historical and future timeframes. In this study, hourly winds from surface station reports and from dynamical downscaling of winds simulated by two different global climate models have been synthesized into historical and future wind climatologies for Alaska. Quantile mapping procedures are used to calibrate wind simulations driven by an atmospheric reanalysis, and the calibrated winds are then used to bias-adjust the full distributions of historical and future winds downscaled from the global climate models. In the resulting climatologies, winds are generally stronger at coastal and offshore (island) locations than at interior sites, where calm conditions are frequent in winter. The season of peak wind speed varies from winter in the coastal and offshore locations to summer in interior areas. High-wind events determined from the hourly data are most frequent during winter at coastal locations. Projected changes for the late 21st century are statistically significant at many locations, and they show a qualitatively similar seasonality in the output from the two models: an increase of mean wind speeds in the cold season and a decrease of mean wind speeds in the warm season. High-wind events are projected by both models to become more frequent in the northern and western Alaska coastal regions, which are precisely the regions in which the protective sea ice cover has decreased (and is projected to decrease further), pointing to increased risks of coastal flooding and erosion.},

This study provides a new global wave power assessment using a dataset that covers the period from 1948 to 2008, which was corrected using altimetry data and validated with buoys in terms of wave power. This study characterizes the mean wave power globally as well as its monthly and seasonal variability. Furthermore, it provides a link with the most relevant climate indices globally. The effect of the interannual variability is especially noteworthy for the Northern Hemisphere, where the seasonality is strongest. Additionally, we detect decadal long-term changes and determine that natural variability could explain a few of the differences found between decades. Lastly, we provide an assessment of the global theoretical wave power that covers the last six decades, compare approaches and estimates, and discuss factors of discrepancy. The global offshore wave power is estimated at 32,000 TW h/yr, which is reduced to 16,000 TW h/yr when considering the direction of the energy. The historical average change is 580 TW h/decade. Our results indicate that the global natural variability could be a more relevant factor in the lifetime of wave farms than the historical long-term changes in wave energy.},

  abstract = {A plume of low-salinity water was observed along the North Carolina coast 100 km south of the mouth of Chesapeake Bay during the Coastal Ocean Processes Pilot field program conducted from August through October 1994. The presence of the plume was episodic, occurring every 3 to 8 days. The timing was related to wind patterns, which influence both the delivery of estuarine discharge to the shelf and the plume's passage down the coast. When not affected by local winds, the low-salinity water was confined to within 7-9 km of the coast and was about 8 m deep. Downwelling winds narrow and deepen the plume, whereas upwelling winds cause it to thin and spread offshore, eventually detaching from the coast. The low-salinity plume propagated along the coast at speeds comparable to linear internal wave phase speed, except when strong downwelling wind conditions caused the plume to be in contact with the bottom. The observed propagation speeds are faster than those predicted by previous numerical modeling efforts. The plumes slowed with distance from the source, as mixing with ambient shelf water reduced the density contrast. This buoyancy source was balanced by an alongshore current with a southward velocity of 0.3 to 0.7 ms\textsuperscript{-1}, bounded by a region of high horizontal velocity shear at the offshore salinity front. The currents observed in the nose of the plume are consistent with properties of an internal gravity current under rotation.},

  abstract = {A high-frequency (1.2 MHz) acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) moored on the seabed has been used to observe the mean and turbulent flow components in a narrow tidally energetic channel over six tidal cycles at neap and spring tides. The Reynolds stress has been estimated from the difference in variance between the along-beam velocities of opposing acoustic beams with a correction for the sampling scheme and bin size. Shear stress was found to vary regularly with the predominantly semidiurnal tidal flow with the stresses on the spring ebb flow (up to 4.5 Pa) being generally greater than on the flood flow (,2 Pa) when the currents are weaker. The vertical structure approximated to linear stress profiles decreasing from maximum values near the bed to almost zero stresses just below the surface. The variation in the bed stress was well represented by a quadratic drag law, based on the depth-mean current, with an estimated drag coefficient of 2.6 6 0.2 3 1023. The production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) followed a regular cycle at the M4 frequency with maximum values exceeding 1 W m23 near the bed during ebb flow at spring tides and decreasing with height to ;1023 W m23 at 2 m below the surface. Production was generally lowest (;1024 W m23) at low water slack, which was longer than high water slack, and is marked by a rapid transition from flood to ebb. During peak ebb and flood the vertical distribution of production and the eddy viscosity Nz are reasonably well described by a proposed model based on the law of the wall and a steady balance between the pressure gradient and a uniform shear stress gradient. The stress values have been incorporated into a trial dynamical balance based on the vertically integrated linearized equation of motion along the channel. The pressure gradient term is determined by two tide gauges separated by 5 km in the along-channel direction. The stress variation is in the correct phase to match the combined slope and acceleration term but is only about 60\% of the magnitude required for balance. It is suggested that this discrepancy may result from an overestimation of the local pressure gradient, which may vary significantly between the tide gauges due to changes in the channel cross section.},

  abstract = {Global wave energy inventories have shown that the west coast of Canada possesses one of the most energetic wave climates in the world, with average annual wave energy transports of 40e50 kW/m occurring at the continental shelf. With this energetic climate, there is an opportunity to generate significant quantities of electricity from this renewable source through the use of wave energy conversion (WEC) technologies. To help evaluate the feasibility of deploying wave energy conversion technologies along the west coast of Vancouver Island, a detailed Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model was developed to assess the wave resource. The SWAN model hindcasted wave conditions along the west coast over the 2005e2012 period, at a 3 h time resolution. Detailed sensitivity studies within this report illustrate that the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Centre's (FNMOC) WaveWatch 3 results exhibited superior model performance when used as wave input boundary conditions. The corresponding Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) wind fields were used as non-stationary wind forcing functions within the computational domain. Yearly and monthly mean variations of spectral and parametric wave characteristics for two reference locations were plotted to indicate both the spatial and temporal variability of the wave climate. The mean annual wave energy transport for Amphitrite Bank was calculated to be 34.5 kW/m, while the shallower second location featured 27.8 kW/m just 500 m from shore. Wave energy resources of this magnitude are not common globally and, as a consequence, signify that the west coast of Vancouver Island may be an excellent candidate location for future wave energy development.},

The current NSRDB provides solar irradiance at a 4-km horizontal resolution for each 30-min interval from 1998 to 2016 computed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Physical Solar Model (PSM) and products from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), the National Ice Center's (NIC's) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The NSRDB irradiance data have been validated and shown to agree with surface observations with mean percentage biases within 5\% and 10\% for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI), respectively. The data can be freely accessed via https://nsrdb.nrel.gov or through an application programming interface (API).

This trend continues until the front edge and face of the leading depression wave become unidentifiable and a near-bottom elevation wave emerges, formed from the trailing face of the initial depression wave and the leading face of the following wave. The transition from depression to elevation waves is diagnosed by the integrated wave vorticity, which changes sign as the wave\dbend s polarity changes sign. This transition is predicted by the sign change of the coefficient of the nonlinear term in the KdV equation, when evaluated using observed profiles of stratification and velocity.},

  abstract = {Lanzarote (Canary Islands, Spain) is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (since 1993) located in the Atlantic Ocean. The island is aiming to change its energy production model in order to reduce its dependence on external, fossil-fuel-based energy sources. The local authorities hope to develop an energy production model based on clean, renewable sources, such as wave energy converters (WECs). This study analyses the island's wave energy resources using a 51-year series of data obtained from numerical modelling (hindcast and forecast). The spatial distribution of wave power is analysed using data from nine points around the island. Significant resources (average wave power exceeding 30 kW/m and average annual wave energy of more than 270 MW h/m) are found to the north of the island, as well as to the west and the east (average wave power 25e30 kW/m). Considerable seasonal variability is found, with winters being rather high-energetic and summers quite mild. Variability coefficients are computed in order to select the best locations for WECs; the composition of the resource at each location is examined in terms of sea states in order to evaluate the suitability of WEC installation. Finally, three sites with similar conditions, all located on the north side of the island, are selected as the best candidates for WEC deployment.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a method for measuring profiles of turbulence quantities using a broadband acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP). The method follows previous work on the continental shelf and extends the analysis to develop estimates of the errors associated with the estimation methods. ADCP data was collected in an unstratified channel and the results of the analysis are compared to theory. This comparison shows that the method provides an estimate of the Reynolds stresses, which is unbiased by Doppler noise, and an estimate of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) which is biased by an amount proportional to the Doppler noise. The noise in each of these quantities as well as the bias in the TKE match well with the theoretical values produced by the error analysis. The quantification of profiles of Reynolds stresses simultaneous with the measurement of mean velocity profiles allows for extensive analysis of the turbulence of the flow. In this paper, we examine the relation between the turbulence and the mean flow through the calculation of u *, the friction velocity, and C d the coefficient of drag. Finally, we calculate quantities of particular interest in turbulence modeling and analysis, the characteristic lengthscales, including a lengthscale which represents the stream-wise scale of the eddies which dominate the Reynolds stresses.}

  abstract = {The authors present a field study of estuarine turbulence in which profiles of Reynolds stresses were directly measured using an ADCP throughout a 25-h tidal day. The dataset that is discussed quantifies turbulent mixing for a water column in northern San Francisco Bay that experiences a sequence of states that includes a weak ebb and flood that are stratified, followed by a strong, and eventually unstratified, ebb and flood. These measurements show that energetic turbulence is confined to a bottom mixed layer by the overlying stratification. Examination of individual Reynolds stress profiles along with profiles of Richardson number and turbulent Froude number shows that the water column can be divided into regions based on the relative importance of buoyancy effects. Using the measured turbulence production rate P, the dissipation rate e is estimated. The observed turbulence had values of e /nN2 . 20 all of the time and e /nN2 . 200 most of the time, suggesting that the observed motions were buoyancy affected turbulence rather than internal waves. However, at times, turbulent Froude numbers in much of the upper-water column were less than one, indicating important stratification effects. Taken as a whole, the data show that stratification affects the turbulent velocity variance q2 most severely; that is, observed reductions in u9w9 are largely associated with small values of q2 rather than with a dramatic reduction in the efficiency with which turbulent motions produce momentum fluxes. Finally, the dataset is compared to predictions made using the popular Mellor\dbend Yamada level 2.5 closure. These comparisons show that the model tends to underestimate the turbulent kinetic energy in regions of strong stratification where the turbulence is strongly inhomogeneous and to overestimate the turbulent kinetic energy in weakly stratified regions. The length scale does not appear to compensate for these errors, and, as a result, similar errors are seen in the eddy viscosity predictions. It is hypothesized that the underestimation of q2 is due to an inaccurate parameterization of turbulence self-transport from the near-bed region to the overlying stratification.}

In a cylindrical tank on a rotating table, saline fluid is injected through an annular mesh encircling a cone of 1/15 slope. The resulting ring of fluid becomes unstable to periodic sinusoidal waves, whose characteristics are examined as a function of the ambient fluid depth, the rotation rate, and the salinity and depth of the dense current, the latter being related to the injection time. For experiments with relatively low-salinity currents, we find the phase speed of the instability is proportional to the rotation rate, Omega, rather than being proportional to the Nof speed, which varies as 1/Omega. Likewise, the number of waves observed is found to be inconsistent with existing theories for baroclinic instability of a dense current on a sloping bottom with a stationary ambient.}

  abstract = {A system of two coupled four-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers was used to collect turbulence measurements over a 36-h period at a highly energetic tidal energy site in Alderney Race. This system enables the evaluation of the six components of the Reynolds stress tensor throughout a large proportion of the water column. The present study provides mean vertical profiles of the velocity, the turbulence intensity and the integral lengthscale along the streamwise, spanwise and vertical direction of the tidal current. Based on our results and considering a tidal-stream energy convertor (TEC) aligned with the current main direction, the main elements of turbulence prone to affect the structure (material fatigue) and to alter power generation would likely be: (i) the streamwise turbulence intensity (I                         x                     ), (ii) the shear stress, [Formula: see text], (iii) the normal stress, [Formula: see text] and (iv) the vertical integral lengthscale (L                         z                     ). The streamwise turbulence intensity, (I                         x                     ), was found to be higher than that estimated at other tidal energy sites across the world for similar height above bottom. Along the vertical direction, the length (L                         z                     ) of the large-scale turbulence eddies was found to be equivalent to the rotor diameter of the TEC Sabella D10. It is considered that the turbulence metrics presented in this paper will be valuable for TECs designers, helping them optimize their designs as well as improve loading prediction through the lifetime of the machines.

The early stage of development of lock-release gravity current experiments is recorded in the laboratory frame of reference and subsequently transformed by software to a frame moving with the current head. Time averages of these statistically stationary flows are computed, with the technique providing not only the mean two-dimensional velocity field but also the vorticity, shear stress and divergence fields, and streamlines of the flows. The distributions of the magnitude of the fluid velocity fluctuation and Reynolds stress complete the picture of the flow. Key features of the flow are broadly in line with earlier qualitative and quantitative investigations, and the detailed measurements presented here confirm some of the most recent findings from numerical simulations.}

  abstract = {Axisymmetric gravity currents in a system rotating around a vertical axis, that result when a dense fluid intrudes horizontally under a less dense ambient fluid, are studied. Situations for which the density difference between the fluid is due either to compositional differences or to suspended particulate matter are considered. The fluid motion is described theoretically by the inviscid shallow-water equations. A `diffusion' equation for the volume fraction in the suspension is derived for the particle-driven case, and two different models for this purpose are presented. We focus attention on situations in which the apparent importance of the Coriolis terms relative to the inertial terms, represented by the parameter [script C] (the inverse of a Rossby number), is not large. Numerical and asymptotic solutions of the governing equations clarify the essential features of the flow field and particle distribution, and point out the striking differences from the non-rotating case (Bonnecaze, Huppert \& Lister 1995). It is shown that the Coriolis effects eventually become dominant; even for small [script C], Coriolis effects are negligible only during an initial period of about one tenth of a revolution. Thereafter the interface of the current acquires a shape which has a downward decreasing profile at the nose and its velocity of propagation begins to decrease to zero more rapidly than in the non-rotating situation. This relates the currents investigated here to the previously studied quasi-steady oceanographic structures called rings, eddies, vortices or lenses, and may throw additional light on the dynamics of their formation. The theoretical results were tested by some preliminary experiments performed in a rotating cylinder of diameter 90 cm filled with a layer of water of depth 10 cm in which a cylinder of heavier saline fluid of diameter 9.4 cm was released.}

Attention is focused on effects due to stratification in the ambient. The investigation uses both a one-layer shallow-water model and Navier Stokes finite-difference simulations. There is good agreement between these two approaches for the energy of the dense fluid (the current). The results indicate that with respect to the behaviour of energy as a function of time we can distinguish between: (a) currents propagating at supercritical speed (with respect to the fastest internal wave in the ambient), including a nose propagating into an unstratified ambient; and (b) currents propagating at subcritical speed, including the strongest effective stratification for which the density at the base of the ambient is equal to that of the current. The stratification enhances the accumulation of potential energy in the ambient and reduces the energy decay (dissipation) of the two-fluid system. The interaction of the internal waves with the head of the current in the subcritical case has no significant influence on the energy balance of the current.}

Solutions for two-dimensional rectangular and axisymmetric geometries, with emphasis on the rotation of the latter, were obtained by a Lax Wendroff scheme. Box-model approximations are also discussed. The axisymmetric and rotating case admits steady-state lens structures, for which approximate and numerical solutions are presented. In general, the stratification reduces the velocity of propagation and enhances the Coriolis effects in a rotating system (in particular, the maximal radius of propagation decreases). Comparisons of the shallow-water results with Navier Stokes simulations and laboratory experiments indicate good agreement, at least for the initial period of propagation. The major deficiency of this shallow-water model is the lack of incorporation of internal waves. In particular, if the propagation is at subcritical speed, the applicability of the model is restricted to the time prior to the first effective interaction between the head of the gravity current and the lowest-order internal wave; an estimate of this position is presented.}

Analytical and numerical results are presented, which reveal the essential flow-field features for various values of the governing dimensionless parameter H, the initial depth ratio of the outer embedding fluid to that of the dense fluid in the lock. It is shown that in the two-dimensional configuration a clear-cut slumping stage develops for any value of H, but for H{$<$}2 this stage is complicated by jumps of the interface (backward and forward moving bores) and constrained maximal nose velocity. The two-layer model provides good qualitative and quantitative agreements with previously published measurements, but the one-layer model mispredicts the dependency of the slumping distance on H. In the axisymmetric configuration a clear-cut slumping stage develops only for values of H close to 1 (shallow ambient), and persists for a relatively short time and distance. The effect of the Froude correlations and implementation to box-model approximations are also discussed.},

Approximately half the population of Alaska resides near its shores,and Anchorage,at its northern end,is the state s largest city and a focus for commerce,industry,recreation,and transportation.Tidal height variations at Anchorage are the second most extreme in the world, exceeded only by those in Canada s Bay of Fundy.Cook Inlet s extreme tidal range and the shallow bathymetry produce extreme tidal currents as well.During winter the marine ice that forms in the Inlet can have a substantial impact on human activities.This report is a compilation of previously published and unpublished information on the climatic,meteorological,oceanographic,and hyrodynamic condi- tions that influence the marine ice cover in Cook Inlet.Biweekly maps,based on historical conditions from 1984 through 1999,are presented that show the expected concentrations and stages of development of the ice cover.These maps were produced by re-analyzing approximately 675 archived ice charts that were produced by the National Weather Service between 1984 and 1999,using ArcView TM GIS software.},

This paper focuses on the possibility of extracting tidal energy from minor tidal channels of Puget Sound by using a hydrodynamic model to quantify the power potential and the associated impact on tidal circulation. The study site is a multi-inlet bay system connected by two narrow inlets, Agate Pass and Rich Passage, to the Main Basin of Puget Sound. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was applied to the study site and validated for tidal elevations and currents. We examined three energy extraction scenarios in which turbines were deployed in each of the two passages and concurrently in both. Extracted power rates and associated changes in tidal elevation, current, tidal flux, and residence time were examined. Maximum instantaneous power rates reached 250~kW, 1550~kW, and 1800~kW, respectively, for the three energy extraction scenarios. Model results suggest that with the level of energy extraction in the three energy extraction scenarios, the impact on tidal circulation is very small. It is worth investigating the feasibility of harnessing tidal energy from minor tidal channels of Puget Sound.},

  abstract = {Cook Inlet in Alaska has been identified as a prime site in the U.S. for potential tidal energy development, because of its enormous tidal power potential that accounts for nearly one-third of the national total. As one important step to facilitate tidal energy development, a tidal hydrodynamic model based on the unstructured-grid, finite-volume community ocean model (FVCOM) was developed for Cook Inlet to characterize the tidal stream energy resource. The model has a grid resolution that varies from about 1000 m at the open boundary to 100\textendash 300 m inside the Inlet. Extensive model validation was achieved by comparing model predictions with field observations for tidal elevation and velocity at various locations in Cook Inlet. The error statistics confirmed the model performs reasonably well in capturing the tidal dynamics in the system, e.g., R2 {$>$} 0.98 for tidal elevation and generally {$>$} 0.9 for velocity. Model results suggest that tides in Cook Inlet evolve from progressive waves at the entrance to standing waves at the upper Inlet, and that semi-diurnal tidal constituents are amplified more rapidly than diurnal constituents. The model output was used to identify hotspots that have high energy potential and warrant additional velocity and turbulence measurements such as East Foreland, where averaged power density exceeds 5 kw/m2. Lastly, a tidal energy extraction simulation was conducted for a hypothetical turbine farm configuration at the Forelands cross section to evaluate tidal energy extraction and resulting changes in far-field hydrodynamics.},

The model was designed for simulating strong interactions between internal gravity waves and topography, e.g. exchange flows in contracting channels, tidally or convectively driven flow over two-dimensional sills or waves propagating onto a shoaling bed. The model is based on the non-hydrostatic, Boussinesq equations of motion for a continuously stratified fluid in a rotating frame, subject to user-configurable boundary conditions. An orthogonal boundary fitting co-ordinate system is used for the numerical computations, which rely on a fourth-order compact differentiation scheme, a third-order explicit time stepping and a multi-grid based pressure projection algorithm. The numerical techniques are described and a suite of validation studies are presented. The validation studies include a pointwise comparison of numerical simulations with both analytical solutions and laboratory measurements of non-linear solitary wave propagation. Simulation results for flows lacking analytical or laboratory data are analysed a posteriori to demonstrate satisfaction of the potential energy balance. Computational results are compared with two-layer hydraulic predictions in the case of exchange flow through a contracting channel. Finally, a simulation of circulation driven by spatially non-uniform surface buoyancy flux in an irregular basin is discussed. Copyright},

This fully nonlinear analytical model is used to examine the kinematic and dynamic factors that control the depth and propagation speed of the density current and the geometric shape of the density current front. The results show that in comparison with the environmental inflow shear, the strength of the internal circulation within the cold pool of a density current plays a secondary role in controlling the depth and propagation speed of the density current, at least one having constant vorticity. The direction of the cold pot circulation can be either clockwise or anticlockwise, not affecting the propagation speed, depth, and geometric shape of an inviscid conservative density current. Physical interpretation of the results is provided in regard to the way that the inflow shear controls the shape of the density current head and produces the `'optimal state'' for supporting long-lived squall lines.}

  abstract = {This paper develops a two-fluid steady-state model of a density current and its front propagating into a uniformly sheared environmental flow. This model is used to examine the kinematic and dynamic factors that control the depth and propagation speed of the density current and the geometric shape of the density current front. For an idealized inviscid flow, the results show that the density current becomes deeper and propagates faster relative to the environmental flow as the shear increases toward positive (i.e., the system-relative inflow speed decreases with height). When the effects of energy loss and negative vorticity generation are taken into account for the entire or physically constrained fractional depth of the upper-layer outflow, multiple solutions are found for two possible flow states: supercritical and subcritical. similar to that of Benjamin. The supercritical (or subcritical) state is characterized by a large (small) Froude number for the downstream upper-layer outflow, in which case the density current is shallower (or much shallower) and propagates slightly faster (or significantly slower) than the idealized inviscid one. The depth and propagation speed of a density current of supercritical (or subcritical) state increase rapidly (or decrease very slowly) as the shear increases toward positive, but change very slightly (or significantly) with the energy loss and/or negative vorticity generation. Applications of the model results to real atmospheric density currents are also discussed.}

  abstract = {The previous idealized two-fluid model of a density current in constant shear is extended to the case where the inflow shear is confined to the low levels. The analytical solution is determined by the conservation of mass, momentum, vorticity, and energy. It is found that a low-level shear acts in a similar manner to a uniform vertical shear in controlling the depth of a steady-state density current. When the shear enhances the low-level flow against the density current propagation, the current is deeper than half of the domain depth. Time-dependent numerical experiments are conducted for a variety of parameter settings, including various depths and strengths of the shear layer. The numerical results agree closely with the theoretical analyses.Numerical experiments are also performed for a case where the initial depth of the density current is set to be comparable to the low-level shear, which is much shallower than that given by the steady-state solution. The circulation at the density current head remains shallow and is nonsteady in this case, whereas the time-averaged flow still exhibits a deep jump updraft pattern that is close to the theoretical solution, suggesting the applicability of the theoretical results to even more transient flows.The simulated flow features are discussed in terms of balanced and unbalanced dynamics, and in the context of forcing and uplifting at the frontal zone in long-lived convective systems. Here the term balance refers to a flow configuration that satisfies the steady-state solution of the idealized theoretical model.}

Wave energy is the largest among all the U.S. MHK energy resources, which include wave energy, ocean current, tidalinstream, ocean thermal energy conversion, and riverinstream. Wave resource characterization is an essential step for regional wave energy assessments, Wave Energy Converter (WEC) project development, site selection and WEC design. The present paper provides an overview of a joint modelling effort by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories on highresolution wave hindcasts to support the U.S. Department of Energy's Water Power Technologies Office's program of wave resource characterization, assessment and classifications in all US coastal regions. Topics covered include the modelling approach, model input requirements, model validation strategies, high performance computing resource requirements, model outputs and data management strategies. Examples of model setup and validation for different regions are provided along with application to development of classification systems, and analysis of regional wave climates. Lessons learned and technical challenges of the long-term, high-resolution regional wave hindcast are discussed.},

This level of detail could be of interest to the Oil and Gas industry for offshore platform engineering, to the offshore wind industry for turbine and array design, to offshore aquaculture production and blue economy development, to coastal communities for extreme hazards mitigation, to global shipping companies and fishermen for a better understanding of weather windows and seasonal wave climate patterns at a spatial resolution that does not exist elsewhere.

  abstract = {Numerical models have been widely used for the resource characterization and assessment of tidal instream energy. The accurate assessment of tidal stream energy resources at a feasibility or project-design scale requires detailed hydrodynamic model simulations or high-quality field measurements. This study applied a three-dimensional finite-volume community ocean model (FVCOM) to simulate the tidal hydrodynamics in the Passamaquoddy\textendash Cobscook Bay archipelago, with a focus on the Western Passage, to assist tidal energy resource assessment. IEC Technical specifications were considered in the model configurations and simulations. The model was calibrated and validated with field measurements. Energy fluxes and power densities along selected cross sections were calculated to evaluate the feasibility of the tidal energy development at several hotspots that feature strong currents. When taking both the high current speed and water depth into account, the model results showed that the Western Passage has great potential for the deployment of tidal energy farms. The maximum extractable power in the Western Passage was estimated using the Garrett and Cummins method. Different criteria and methods recommended by the IEC for resource characterization were evaluated and discussed using a sensitivity analysis of energy extraction for a hypothetical tidal turbine farm in the Western Passage.},

The China Sea wind energy density and wave energy density were calculated using the CCMP wind and WW3 model simulation results. The China Sea wind energy and wave energy resource were analyzed, synthetically considering the value of energy density, probability of exceedance of energy density level, exploitable wind speed and exploitable significant wave height (SWH), the stability of energy density, total storage and exploitable storage of energy resources, thus providing the guidance for the location of wind and wave power plants. Our results show that most of the China Sea contains abundant wave energy and offshore wind energy resources, with wind energy density above 150 W/m2, wave energy density above 2 kW/m, high occurrence of exploitable wind and wave energy in large scale waters, wind energy storage above 2 \^A 103 kW h m-2, wave energy storage above 4 \^A 104 kW h m-1. The richest area is in the northern South China Sea (wind energy density 350\textendash 600 W/m2, wave energy density 10\textendash 16 kW/m, wind energy storage 3 \^A 103\textendash 5 \^A 103 kW h m-2, wave energy storage 8 \^A 104\textendash 16 \^A 104 kW h m-1), followed by southern South China Sea and the East China Sea (wind energy density 150\textendash 450 W/m2, wave energy density 4\textendash 12 kW/m, wind energy storage 2 \^A 103\textendash 4 \^A 103 kW h m-2, wave energy storage 4 \^A 104\textendash 12 \^A 104 kW h m-1).
